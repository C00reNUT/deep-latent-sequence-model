Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift .	They're just punished for the field .
Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set On the fair daughter of rich Capulet .	Then plainly know my heart's love is even making the love of Bianca ' love Bianca .
As mine on hers , so hers is set on mine , And all combined , save what thou must combine By holy marriage .	As mine on hers , so hers on being on mine , and all we'll help , because they're doing there , it's all noble or marriage .
When and where and how We met , we wooed and made exchange of vow , I'll tell thee as we pass , but this I pray : That thou consent to marry us today .	When and where , and they met what you saw , and Duchess of loyalty , I'll tell you , as we remember , but I don't think to hear your daughter , you're ready to support you .
Holy Saint Francis , what a change is here !	You're sweating goddess , what a change is here !
Is Rosaline , whom thou didst love so dear , So soon forsaken ?	Is happening , if anyone did love so much , but it'll love me ?
Young men's love then lies Not truly in their hearts , but in their eyes .	Young men's love just cried down because they want their own eyes , but in their eyes .
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears , Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears .	The sun was not happy when your father's relatives , the old deed did well live in my own ears .
Lo , here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit Of an old tear that is not washed off yet .	Damn , here is your handkerchief from the duke of an old family has got him next , but all that same .
If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine , Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline .	If I've been saying and they get up these bars , and these others are all for this .
And art thou changed ?	And you're all okay ?
Pronounce this sentence then : Women may fall when there's no strength in men .	Damn this ambition where then : others are condemned to die when you take anything in .
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline .	You're me just like my plans .
For doting , not for loving , pupil mine .	For you're right , for loving me , good man .
And badest me bury love .	And don't kill me .
Not in a grave , To lay one in , another out to have .	Not in a grave , I'll catch your head out , like to enter a bubble .
I pray thee , chide not .	I don't understand what I'm saying .
The other did not so .	The other only died .
Oh , she knew well Thy love did read by rote , that could not spell .	Oh , she knew her love : I saw it by showing me that letter , it's not shame .
But come , young waverer , come , go with me , In one respect I'll thy assistant be , For this alliance may so happy prove To turn your households ' rancor to pure love .	But come , young Well , come , go with me , like your own respect I'm telling you , and this day may be so happy to use your ears to disfigure your sins .
Oh , let us hence .	Oh , let us go .
I stand on sudden haste .	I stand on my mood .
Wisely and slow .	Large and increasing .
They stumble that run fast .	They probably doing that Lucentio .
Where the devil should this Romeo be ?	Where the devil should this be counted ?
Came he not home tonight ?	Didn't he just hide him ?
Not to his father's .	Not to his father's .
I spoke with his man .	I spoke with his man .
Why , that same pale hard-hearted wench , that Rosaline , Torments him so , that he will sure run mad .	Why , that same pale too low , that I'm sure , just that , so he will run mad .
Tybalt , the kinsman to old Capulet , Hath sent a letter to his father's house .	Ma'am , the Captain wants to be damned , and sent him to a king's house .
A challenge , on my life .	A horse , on my life .
Romeo will answer it .	Bloodshed will answer it .
Any man that can write may answer a letter .	Any man that can write to marry a post while .
Nay , he will answer the letter's master , how he dares , being dared .	Yes , he will answer the English , so he knows what he was , being feared .
Alas , poor Romeo !	Alas , poor Glou-cester !
And is he a man to encounter Tybalt ?	And is he a man to rebel ?
Why , what is Tybalt ?	Why , what is happening ?
The what ?	The what ?
Without his roe , like a dried herring .	It's his heart." , like a wildly lie .
O flesh , flesh , how art thou fishified !	Oh , flesh , where was my guests doing me !
Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in .	Now is he for the group that size that by
Good morrow to you both .	Good morning to you both .
What counterfeit did I give you ?	What awful did I give you ?
The slip , sir , the slip .	The carriages , sir , the jeweler .
Can you not conceive ?	Can you recognize him ?
Nay , I am the very pink of courtesy .	Yes , I am the very embodiment of courtesy .
I serve as good a man as you .	I want for a good man as you .
No better .	No better .
Well , sir .	Well , sir .
You lie .	You lie .
You know not what you do .	You know what you're thinking .
What , art thou drawn among these heartless hinds ?	What , you're talking about these lazy men ?
Come between us , good Benvolio .	Come between us , good Mr. Depression .
My wits faints .	My wits decision .
Switch and spurs , switch and spurs , or I'll cry a match .	Order and Flavio , and hurry , and I'll cry a lot for a match .
Nay , if our wits run the wild-goose chase , I am done , for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits than , I am sure , I have in my whole five .	Yes , if our wits run from the Ceres , I don't think , for I've been more in the center of your own spirit than I am , I hope , I have in my whole plan .
Was I with you there for the goose ?	Was I with you there in the woman ?
Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not there for the goose .	You're murdering him for me as anything else , and I've got him for the harvest .
I will bite thee by the ear for that jest .	I will bite you by the ear for that joke .
Nay , good goose , bite not .	Yes , good Meg , don't like this .
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting .	Your wit is a very bitter song .
It is a most sharp sauce .	It is a most appropriate place .
And is it not well served into a sweet goose ?	And is it really you lost into a sweet clothes ?
Oh , here's a wit of cheveril , that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad !	Oh , here's a wit of war , that from an odd omen to be an extra example !
I stretch it out for that word "broad , " which , added to the goose , proves thee far and wide a broad goose .	I pulled it out for that word , which , " it's the devil , to assume you are lying and high a poor Roman .
Why , is not this better now than groaning for love ?	Why , is not this better now for love than love ?
Now art thou sociable .	Now you're talking about .
Now art thou Romeo .	Now you're talking about .
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large .	Whatever we can have told your poor orders .
Oh , thou art deceived .	Oh , you're very satisfied .
I would have made it short , for I was come to the whole depth of my tale , and meant , indeed , to occupy the argument no longer .	I would have made it short , for I was going to the whole bottom of my kingdom , and said , indeed , to satisfy the argument no longer .
Here's goodly gear .	Here's a stretcher .
Two , two , a shirt and a smock .	Two , two , a penny , and a moist .
Peter !	Whew !
Anon !	Whew !
My fan , Peter .	My name's Lucius , .
God ye good morrow , gentlemen .	God aren't good morning , gentlemen .
God ye good e'en , fair gentlewoman .	God aren't good luck , fair lady .
Is it good e'en ?	Is it good luck ?
Tis no less , I tell you , for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon .	It's no less , I tell you , for the sake of the hand is now mulling over the floor of the city .
Out upon you !	Shame on you !
What a man are you ?	What a man are you ?
One , gentlewoman , that God hath made , himself to mar .	One , sir , that God has made himself to look , who kills for .
By my troth , it is well said .	By my troth , it is well said .
For himself to mar , " quoth he ?	For himself to support , " who is he ?
Gentlemen , can any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo ?	Gentlemen , can any of you tell me where I don't find the young virgins ' hair ?
I can tell you , but young Romeo will be older when you have found him than he was when you sought him .	I can tell you , but young women will be older when you have found him when he was because you bought him when you wanted to .
I am the youngest of that name , for fault of a worse .	I don't have the name of that , for hardly thought of a share of gold .
You say well .	You say well .
Yea , is the worst well ?	Yes , is the worst coming ?
Very well took , i ' faith , wisely , wisely .	Very well , here's being , enough , wisely , wisely .
She will indite him to some supper .	She will arrive to him some at dinner .
So ho !	So ho !
What hast thou found ?	What has she been ?
Romeo , will you come to your father's ?	Niece , will you come to your father's ?
We'll to dinner , thither .	We'll to dinner , Bassanio .
I will follow you .	I will follow you .
A gentleman , Nurse , that loves to hear himself talk , and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month .	A gentleman , gullible Petruchio , that loves to hear someone anymore , and will speak more in a word than he will remain to a hurry in to a moment .
An he speak any thing against me , I'll take him down , an he were lustier than he is , and twenty such Jacks .	An he speak any thing against me , I'll take him down , he were an angel , and he were dressed , and twenty times in his feet .
And if I can not , I'll find those that shall .	And if I can not , I'll find that people are .
Scurvy knave !	Help me !
I am none of his flirt-gills .	I don't have any of it .
I am none of his skains-mates .	I don't have any of it .
I saw no man use you at his pleasure .	I saw no man use you at his own feelings .
If I had , my weapon should quickly have been out , I warrant you .	If I had , my tongue would have already been out , I don't know you .
I dare draw as soon as another man if I see occasion in a good quarrel and the law on my side .	I dare allow as soon as a man I see if I weren't good in a good mood and the law on my side .
Now , afore God , I am so vexed that every part about me quivers .	Now , God forbid , I am so hairy that I'm scared about me .
Scurvy knave !	Help me !
Nurse , commend me to thy lady and mistress .	Instead , listen to me your advice and mistress .
I protest unto thee , Good heart , and i ' faith , I will tell her as much .	I curse about me , good king , and faster , I will tell her , I will tell her as much .
Lord , Lord , she will be a joyful woman .	Lord , Lord , she will be a real idea .
What wilt thou tell her , Nurse ?	What can she tell her , cousin ?
Thou dost not mark me .	You're not thinking about him .
And there she shall at Friar Lawrence ' cell Be shrived and married .	And there she must get crippled yourself to see if he's staying and die .
And stay , good Nurse .	And stay , good sirs .
Behind the abbey wall Within this hour my man shall be with thee And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair , Which to the high top-gallant of my joy Must be my convoy in the secret night .	Picture the dawn plot like this hour my heart can be with you and bring you up like a pig , and the high to my life of my blood is not my disgrace in the poor princes .
Farewell .	Farewell .
Be trusty , and I'll quit thy pains .	Be convincing , and I'll beg your favor .
Farewell .	Farewell .
Commend me to thy mistress .	Help me to your mistress .
Now God in heaven bless thee !	Now God in heaven bless me !
Hark you , sir .	Hello you , sir .
What sayst thou , my dear Nurse ?	What happens , my just dear ?
Is your man secret ?	Is your wife awake ?
Did you ne'er hear say , "Two may keep counsel , putting one away" ?	Did you never understand what one , don't keep repeating , won't curse one ?
Warrant thee , my man's as true as steel .	Ma'am , my liege , my true sovereign as yours .
Well , sir , my mistress is the sweetest lady. , Lord , Lord !	Well , sir , my mistress is the sweetest throne , Lord , Lord , God !
when 'twas a little prating thing. , Oh , there is a nobleman in town , one Paris , that would fain lay knife aboard , but she , good soul , had as lief see a toad , a very toad , as see him .	Until it's a little depressed , Oh , there is a busy in town , one , that would stop God's knife , but , she could beg as you'd see a disaster , a very toad , as on him , as I see .
I anger her sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer man .	I recognize her spells and tell her that is the criminal man isn't his .
But , I'll warrant you , when I say so , she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world .	But , I'll look you , when I say , she wouldn't be as pale as any military thing in the world .
Doth not Ay , Nurse , what of that ?	Doesn't it please , son , what of that ?
Both with an Ah , mocker , that's the dog's name .	Both with an idiot , that's the goddess , that's the name .
Commend me to thy lady .	Help me to your lady .
Ay , a thousand times. , Peter !	Yes , a thousand , onto heaven !
Anon !	Whew !
Before and apace .	Before and hurry .
The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse .	The clock struck nine years when he did shake the breezes .
Perchance she can not meet him .	Wasn't she can even leave him .
That's not so .	That's not so .
Oh , she is lame !	Oh , she is unfaithful !
Love's heralds should be thoughts , Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams , Driving back shadows over louring hills .	You'll attack them , still be brief , which ten times lighter than the trees , sailing sadly back to blow their backs .
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill Of this day's journey , and from nine till twelve Is three long hours , yet she is not come .	Now is the sun on the battlefield too expensive with the island , and from ten times the three hours here , she thinks not come to be married , since she is not come .
Had she affections and warm youthful blood , She would be as swift in motion as a ball .	If she sleep and smooth blood , just as she were as big in a hurry as milk as a nightingale .
My words would bandy her to my sweet love , And his to me .	My words would listen to my own love , but to kill me to his own .
But old folks , many feign as they were dead , Unwieldy , slow , heavy , and pale as lead .	But old guy , many as they were dead , lying , oh , and grim as you want and lives .
O God , she comes. , O honey Nurse , what news ?	Oh , God , she's lying , oh , what news ?
Hast thou met with him ?	Has he taken with him ?
Send thy man away .	Send your name away .
Peter , stay at the gate .	Peter , stay at the gate .
Now , good sweet Nurse , O Lord , why look'st thou sad ?	Now , good sweet , Oh , Lord , why you're the sad ?
Though news be sad , yet tell them merrily .	Though news isn't sad , yet I'm making fun of my guests .
If good , thou shamest the music of sweet news By playing it to me with so sour a face .	If good , he's the music of sweet news that's giving me to it with so much a bit while in his own heart .
I am aweary .	I am upset .
Give me leave awhile .	Give me leave away .
Fie , how my bones ache !	Hey , how my bones lives !
I would thou hadst my bones and I thy news .	I would have my journey to you , your highness .
Can you not stay awhile ?	Can you just stay Stephano ?
Do you not see that I am out of breath ?	Do you see that I am out of breath ?
How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath ?	How does it out of breath when you're making me evil to say that you're talking to me out of breath ?
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse .	The excuse that she does make in this delay more than the heavens himself deserves to excuse the story .
Is thy news good , or bad ?	Is your news good , or bad ?
Answer to that .	Just to that .
Say either , and I'll stay the circumstance .	Say either , and I'll stay the rumors .
Let me be satisfied .	Let me be satisfied .
Is 't good or bad ?	Is it good or bad ?
Well , you have made a simple choice .	Well , you have had a simple father .
You know not how to choose a man .	You know how to say to a dog .
Romeo !	Yoo-hoo !
No , not he , though his face be better than any man's , yet his leg excels all men's , and for a hand and a foot and a body , though they be not to be talked on , yet they are past compare .	No , not he , though his face better than any man's , yet his voice will die all , and for a hand and a while , and I will always be able to be carried on , yet they are past adult feasts .
He is not the flower of courtesy , but , I'll warrant him , as gentle as a lamb .	He is not the flower of affection , but I'll outmaneuver him , as gentle as a whirlpool , Lend its own a house .
Go thy ways , wench .	Go your ways , sir .
Serve God .	Thank God .
What , have you dined at home ?	What , have you left home ?
No , no .	No , no .
But all this did I know before .	But all this did I know before .
What says he of our marriage ?	What says he is our daughter ?
What of that ?	What about that ?
My back a ' t ' other side .	My back a hat and we're all here .
Ah , my back , my back !	Ah , my back , my hat !
I ' faith , I am sorry that thou art not well .	I pick a gentleman , I feel even that you don't know me .
Sweet , sweet , sweet Nurse , tell me , what says my love ?	Sweet , sweet , sweet mermaid , don't tell me what about my name ?
Your love says , like an honest gentleman , and a courteous , and a kind , and a handsome , and , I warrant , a virtuous , Where is your mother ?	Your love is , like an honest gentleman , and a prating idiot , a kind and handsome , and a stupid , and I'm sure , a cobbler , is your mother ?
Where is my mother ?	Where is my mother ?
Why , she is within .	Why , she is upset .
Where should she be ?	Where should she be ?
How oddly thou repliest !	How awful I won !
Your love says , like an honest gentleman , 'Where is your mother ?	Your love ? " That's like an honest angel , is your mother ?
O God's lady dear , Are you so hot ?	Oh , noble lady , don't you think I'm so excessively a traitor ?
Marry , come up , I trow .	Instead , come up , I insist .
Is this the poultice for my aching bones ?	Is this the latest for my friends ?
Henceforward do your messages yourself .	They're ready your talents .
Here's such a coil .	Here's such a moment .
Come , what says Romeo ?	Come , what says I'm doing ?
Have you got leave to go to shrift today ?	Have you got ready to get back to him today ?
I have .	I have .
Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence's cell .	Then please help you to listen to England .
There stays a husband to make you a wife .	There isn't a husband to make you a wife .
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks .	Now comes the blood of her in your hand .
They'll be in scarlet straight at any news .	They'll be in luxury at any early .
Hie you to church .	Thank you to church .
I must another way To fetch a ladder , by the which your love Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark .	I won't another luck to get on a beggar's place , by the which your love has a pregnant wanted to be everything suddenly too deeply .
Go .	Go .
I'll to dinner .	I'll to dinner .
Hie you to the cell .	Thank you to the cottage .
I do but keep the peace .	I do don't like the peace .
Put up thy sword , Or manage it to part these men with me .	Put up your sword , and whatever it happened to part these men from him .
What , drawn , and talk of peace ?	What , hurry , and talk to my peace ?
I hate the word , As I hate hell , all Montagues , and thee .	I hate the word , as I hate myself , all indirectly , and , and myself .
Have at thee , coward !	Have at me , darling !
Clubs , bills , and partisans !	Humble , hurry , and stop !
Strike !	Stop !
Beat them down !	Beat them down !
Down with the Capulets !	Struggling with the doddering fool !
Down with the Montagues !	Play with the doddering fool !
What noise is this ?	What noise is this ?
My sword , I say !	My sword , I say !
Old Montague is come , And flourishes his blade in spite of me .	They're off come , but I'm sure his dagger in spite of me .
Thou villain Capulet !	Evil villain !
Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe .	You'd better not fight while to wear a lot to keep .
Hie to high fortune !	Listen to high fortune !
Honest Nurse , farewell .	Honest , listen , .
Amen , amen .	Amen , goodbye .
But come what sorrow can , It can not countervail the exchange of joy That one short minute gives me in her sight .	But come what sorrow can , it can not be the guilty of men by one beautiful another man who's got up in her face .
Therefore love moderately .	Please love anything .
Long love doth so .	Can't love just so .
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow .	Too swift mud as soon as bad .
Here comes the lady .	Here comes the lady .
Oh , so light a foot Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint .	Oh , so light a foot I could wear out the imperfections of hell .
Good even to my ghostly confessor .	Good even my commander for it .
Romeo shall thank thee , daughter , for us both .	Nice we'll thank you , daughter , for us both .
As much to him , else is his thanks too much .	As much to say , it'll do his thanks too much .
Ah , Juliet , if the measure of thy joy Be heaped like mine , and that thy skill be more To blazon it , then sweeten with thy breath This neighbor air , and let rich music's tongue Unfold the imagined happiness that both Receive in either by this dear encounter .	Ah , sir , if the armies of your joy is no like your face , and that your heart doesn't be more to it , and then your face with your country , and let them say that poor miserable boys , and I'll believe all the high animals that both in both make true deep love .
Conceit , more rich in matter than in words , Brags of his substance , not of ornament .	Honestly , more lovely enough in matter than words , kick in his cap , not of Tunis .
Come , come with me , and we will make short work .	Come , come with me , and we will make short work .
I pray thee , good Mercutio , let's retire .	I don't know , good sir , let's go .
Thou art like one of those fellows that , when he enters the confines of a tavern , claps me his sword upon the table and says "God send me no need of thee ! " and , by the operation of the second cup , draws it on the drawer when indeed there is no need .	You're like one of those that two , when he stamped the owner of the middle , a spendthrift me his sword and says the goddess of him and asks , he got no care of me ! " and , by the mountain , like the second example , it is the tragedy , there must have no need .
Am I like such a fellow ?	Am I like such a coward ?
Come , come , thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy , and as soon moved to be moody , and as soon moody to be moved .	Come , come , you're as nice as a Jack in your state as in Rome , and as soon as to be deceived , and as many strong as to be human .
And what to ?	And what to ?
Nay , an there were two such , we should have none shortly , for one would kill the other .	Yes , it's there two such friends , we have only deserved something , for one would kill the other the qualities of the earth .
Thou , why , thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast .	You're sure , why has a fool with a man that has a hair more hair than a hair in his beard than he's been captured .
Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts , having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes .	You're cowards with a man for a drinking , who've got no more reason to have it because but I've been scolded .
What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel ?	What woman was such an innocent woman is wearing him like a stupid ?
Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat , and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarreling .	Your head is as full of fresh as an offering of birth is right out , and yet your head has been given as an eggshell and for blowing as an ogre .
Thou hast quarreled with a man for coughing in the street because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun .	You've been pleased with a man for negotiation in the street and he treated that you've been cozying up in the ocean dancing up in the sky .
Didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter ?	Didn't I have out things with a dove for his new head before he was to a wildcat ?
With another , for tying his new shoes with old ribbon ?	With another , for his new fits he with old Shylock's house ?
And yet thou wilt tutor me from quarreling !	And yet he's trying to hide me !
An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art , any man should buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter .	An I were so lucky to argue as you , he's been doing the man that I'd rip his soul for the high and a death and a terrible .
The fee simple ?	The handwriting killed ?
O simple !	Oh , simple !
By my head , here comes the Capulets .	By my head , here comes the rumors .
By my heel , I care not .	By my boldness , I don't care .
Couple it with something .	Got it for something .
Make it a word and a blow .	Make it a word and a peaceful cry .
You shall find me apt enough to that , sir , an you will give me occasion .	You couldn't find me anything enough to that , sir , an ordinary men you give me to you .
Could you not take some occasion without giving ?	Could you just take some dissatisfaction to you without ?
Mercutio , thou consort'st with Romeo .	Honestly , I'm going with me .
What , dost thou make us minstrels ?	What , does it make us honest ?
An thou make minstrels of us , look to hear nothing but discords .	An they've been seen of us , don't try to worry about how much we deserve .
We talk here in the public haunt of men .	We talk here in the public formations of men .
Either withdraw unto some private place , And reason coldly of your grievances , Or else depart .	Either hello to some little place , but what happened of your plan , and he'll stay everything for you .
Here all eyes gaze on us .	Here all eyes fall on .
Men's eyes were made to look and let them gaze .	Their eyes were made to look and let them be willing .
I will not budge for no man's pleasure , I .	I will not choose for any man's pleasure , I have .
Well , peace be with you , sir .	Well , peace be with you , sir .
Here comes my man .	Here comes my man .
But I'll be hanged , sir , if he wear your livery .	But I'll be hanged , sir , if he was your proxy .
Tybalt , the reason that I have to love thee Doth much excuse the appertaining rage To such a greeting .	Honestly , the reason that I have to love you completely loved the flesh and force him to kill a crime .
Villain am I none .	Right I'm offended .
Therefore , farewell .	Please , listen .
I see thou know'st me not .	I see you're lying about it .
Boy , this shall not excuse the injuries That thou hast done me .	Boy , this doesn't excuse me to the law who have done me .
Therefore turn and draw .	Please turn and listen .
And so , good Capulet , which name I tender As dearly as my own , be satisfied .	And so , good Shylock , which I loved you as beautiful as my own , I'm sure I kept up .
O calm dishonourable , vile submission !	Oh calm , oh , another !
What wouldst thou have with me ?	What didn't you have to me ?
Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears ?	Will you abandon your sword out of the armor like his ears ?
Make haste , lest mine be about your ears ere it be out .	Make haste , because you'll be lost about your ears as it happened .
I am for you .	I am for you .
Gentle Mercutio , put thy rapier up .	Gentle sir , put your hat .
Away , Tybalt .	Listen , goodbye .
I am hurt .	I don't hurt .
A plague o ' both your houses !	A plague over the door !
I am sped .	I am satisfied .
Is he gone and hath nothing ?	Is he nearby and have nothing ?
What , art thou hurt ?	What , you're going to ?
Marry , 'tis enough .	Actually , it's coming .
Where is my page ? , Go , villain , fetch a surgeon .	Where is my slippers , Come , villain , fairies , a coward .
Courage , man .	Terrible , man .
The hurt can not be much .	The hurt can not be lost .
No , 'tis not so deep as a well nor so wide as a church-door , but 'tis enough , 'twill serve .	No , it's not so deep as a saint as so many as a military behavior , but it's going , don't try to work .
Ask for me tomorrow , and you shall find me a grave man .	Ask for me tomorrow , and you shall find me a grave to me .
I am peppered , I warrant , for this world .	I am ashamed , I don't know , for this .
A plague o ' both your houses !	A plague over the door !
Zounds , a dog , a rat , a mouse , a cat to scratch a man to death !	Imagine , a dog , a toy , a dowry , a penny to catch a man to death on a man !
A braggart , a rogue , a villain that fights by the book of arithmetic !	A drunkard , a jerk , a villain that keeps up the cup of France's disgusting !
Why the devil came you between us ?	Why the devil falls on us ?
I was hurt under your arm .	I was hurt at your letter .
I thought all for the best .	I thought all for the best .
Help me into some house , Benvolio , Or I shall faint .	Help me into some house , wandering , or you'll always end .
A plague o ' both your houses !	A plague over the door !
They have made worms ' meat of me .	They have made them crazy until I see .
I have it , And soundly too .	I have it , since she's lying .
Your houses !	Your features !
O Romeo , Romeo , brave Mercutio is dead !	Oh , Fate , oh , brave night !
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again .	Here comes the Nile mood on dinner .
Alive in triumph , and Mercutio slain !	They're in triumph , and sullen !
Either thou or I , or both , must go with him .	Either get I or , or both , we'll go with him .
Thou , wretched boy , that didst consort him here Shalt with him hence .	You're a wretched , boy , that they don't sleep with him here .
This shall determine that .	This won't bet that .
Romeo , away , be gone !	Hurry , away , be gone !
The citizens are up , and Tybalt slain .	The actors are up , and approaching Caesar .
Stand not amazed .	You're just sick .
The Prince will doom thee death If thou art taken .	The Prince will probably loved me what you're talking about .
Hence , be gone , away !	Wait , be gone , Eros !
Why dost thou stay ?	Why does he stay ?
Which way ran he that killed Mercutio ?	Which way ran he that killed ?
Tybalt , that murderer , which way ran he ?	Isn't that , everyone will think you want to sink ?
There lies that Tybalt .	There lies that time .
Speak , nephew .	Speak , hurry .
Were you by when it began ?	Were you when they're wrong when it is ?
Where are the vile beginners of this fray ?	Where are the vile family of this ?
O noble prince , I can discover all The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl .	Oh noble prince , I can explain all the rewards of this fatal flower .
There lies the man , slain by young Romeo , That slew thy kinsman , brave Mercutio .	There lies the man , sitting by the young man , who yell by your brave fellow , devil .
Tybalt , my cousin !	Ma'am , my cousin !
O my brother's child !	Oh , my brother's child !
O cousin , cousin !	Oh , cousin , listen !
Benvolio , who began this bloody fray ?	Ever , who began this bloody storm ?
Romeo , he cries aloud , "Hold , friends !	Play , I jump on curses , come , friends !
Friends , part ! " and , swifter than his tongue , His agile arm beats down their fatal points , And 'twixt them rushes , underneath whose arm An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life Of stout Mercutio , and then Tybalt fled .	Friends , part ! " and , and his tongue , his hat will stop down their own flag , and if them starts , from God's death , given the crown from her. ' chins from the life , and then sighing and Cupid comes .
But by and by comes back to Romeo , Who had but newly entertained revenge , And to 't they go like lightning , for ere I Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain .	But by and by morning to walk , and we had even landed , and I'll revenge you like birds , for when I have to sleep with them , you'd like to commit them is to fight below .
And , as he fell , did Romeo turn and fly .	And , as he fell , wouldn't turn around and pine and fire .
This is the truth , or let Benvolio die .	This is the truth , or let I'm dying .
He speaks not true .	He speaks her right .
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife , And all those twenty could but kill one life .	Some fiery water in this island seem black , and all the rumors who had made anything one deserves to turn .
I beg for justice , which thou , Prince , must give .	I beg for justice , which , Prince , must give to me .
Romeo slew Tybalt .	They're warning louder .
Romeo must not live .	It'll must be alone .
Romeo slew him ; he slew Mercutio .	They're around him ; he feels like it .
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe ?	Who now the price of his own happiness he will make ?
His fault concludes but what the law should end , The life of Tybalt .	His fault is even when the law has decided , the rumors of life .
I have an interest in your hearts ' proceeding .	I have an ambassador in your command already , sir .
But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine That you shall all repent the loss of mine .	But I'll bandy you with so strong a fine while you can't see the law of mine own suffering .
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses .	I will be perfectly to protect and thieves .
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses , Therefore use none .	I'd think nor yours can escape me , don't excuse it .
Bear hence this body and attend our will .	Give me this land and join your tent .
Mercy but murders , pardoning those that kill .	Stop but righteousness , those that misery has .
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites By their own beauties , or , if love be blind , It best agrees with night .	Please can see to do their biggest sins in their own feelings , or if , love I'm better , It seems more bitter with night .
Come , civil night , Thou sober-suited matron , all in black , And learn me how to lose a winning match Played for a pair of stainless maidenhoods .	Come , civil night , you've been wounded , because in all awful , just through me how to lose a foot for a pair of green strokes , and there's a partridge end .
Hood my unmanned blood bating in my cheeks , With thy black mantle , till strange love , grow bold , Think true love acted simple modesty .	Weren't my flesh lies in my eyes , but your own woman , because I'm beautiful , wrong , kind curses , love likely .
Come , night .	Come , night .
Come , Romeo .	Come , explain .
Come , thou day in night , For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back .	Come , I'm standing in night , and you've brought up the night of fighting outside than your courage is even a sleepy distance on your veins .
And when I shall die , Take him and cut him out in little stars , And he will make the face of heaven so fine That all the world will be in love with night And pay no worship to the garish sun .	And when I won't die , I'll cut him out and cut him out in private time , since he will make the face of heaven so fine the world will be in love with him and return to the same medicine .
The cords That Romeo bid thee fetch ?	The same sin I get up ?
Ay , ay , the cords .	Yes , yes , the penalty .
Ay me , what news ?	Yes me , what news ?
Why dost thou wring thy hands ?	Why does he attract a king's ?
Ah , welladay !	Ah , oh !
We are undone , lady , we are undone !	We are lucky , sir , we deserve out of !
Alack the day !	Hello the day !
Can heaven be so envious ?	Can heaven be so dumb ?
Romeo can , Though heaven can not .	Absolutely to , which will stop your husband .
What devil art thou that dost torment me thus ?	What devil was that you want to hear me ?
This torture should be roared in dismal hell .	This madman should be in public oppression .
Hath Romeo slain himself ?	Does they're room ?
Say thou but "ay , " And that bare vowel Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice .	Say you're but unfaithful , but that beautiful creature , the only eye of France's nephew .
I am not I if there be such an Or those eyes shut that makes thee answer "ay." If he be slain , say "ay , " or if not , "no." Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe .	I don't think I could be there by an ordinary eyes that made us even if he hadn't done him , he wouldn't , or , if not , if only sounds about me underground , and my or if
To prison , eyes , ne'er look on liberty .	To prison , because Lysander are just a sleepy sea .
Vile earth , to earth resign .	They're earth , and to heaven .
O Tybalt , Tybalt , the best friend I had !	Oh , Fate , oh the best friend I had !
That ever I should live to see thee dead .	That ever I should live to see you dead .
Is Romeo slaughtered , and is Tybalt dead ?	Is homely age , and is loyal ?
My dearest cousin and my dearer lord ?	My dearest cousin and my lord ?
Tybalt is gone , and Romeo banished .	They're coming , and calm ,
O God , did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood ?	Oh God , did help me perform up here ?
It did , it did .	It did , it will .
Alas the day , it did .	Alas the day , it did .
O serpent heart hid with a flowering face !	Oh , wise ship ! , My own heart !
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave ?	Did ever necessarily keep so beautiful a crime ?
Dove-feathered raven , wolvish-ravening lamb !	Hey , Jesus ,
O nature , what hadst thou to do in hell When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend In moral paradise of such sweet flesh ?	Oh , why , what had you to do in hell when you're a criminal ago in the very moment of abused Bianca than have killed a lovely jacket of flesh ?
Was ever book containing such vile matter So fairly bound ?	Was ever okay like bad name exactly so stupid ?
Ah , where's my man ? , Give me some aqua vitae. , These griefs , these woes , these sorrows make me old .	Ah , where's my man ? , Give me some bodily head. , these king , these balls , make me still make my master .
Shame come to Romeo !	Shame over to hell !
Blistered be thy tongue For such a wish !	They're good only an ass for my own thought !
He was not born to shame .	He was just born to say .
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit , For 'tis a throne where honor may be crowned .	Upon his personal virtue has turned out , but it's a ship's family , if you aren't lowly prized .
Sole monarch of the universal earth , Oh , what a beast was I to chide at him !	Just slip of the earth , young man , what a beast was I to laugh at him !
Will you speak well of him that killed your cousin ?	Will you speak well of that Brutus ?
But wherefore , villain , didst thou kill my cousin ?	But why , villain , could I kill my cousin ?
That villain cousin would have killed my husband .	That cousin villain would have killed my husband .
All this is comfort .	All this is comfort .
Wherefore weep I then ?	What's Hermia else I will ?
I would forget it fain , But oh , it presses to my memory , Like damned guilty deeds to sinners ' minds .	I would beg it where , oh , oh , it pleases my memory , to wear my country spirits from grieving .
Tybalt is dead , and Romeo banished."	Tyranny is dead , and Rosencrantz !
That "banished , " that one word "banished" Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts .	That smelled , " that one word you're already to search Bassanio's age .
Tybalt's death Was woe enough , if it had ended there .	Ever death who's long enough , if it had happened there .
Or , if sour woe delights in fellowship And needly will be ranked with other griefs , Why followed not , when she said "Tybalt's dead , " "Thy father" or "thy mother , " nay , or both , Which modern lamentations might have moved ?	Or , if they dies in case and will be embarrassed , will be free with you who , but said I said , "and dead , or furious , " or I know , who was moved , " or both of my cheeks , being innocent , who killed them ?
But with a rearward following Tybalt's death , "Romeo is banished." To speak that word , Is father , mother , Tybalt , Romeo , Juliet , All slain , all dead .	But with a series wound around , Caesar is incredible , speak to him that word , father , mother , Yes , oh , invasion , all dead .
Romeo is banished." There is no end , no limit , measure , bound , In that word's death .	They're like "G" is no bet , no limit , oh , it's bound , that was in my death .
No words can that woe sound .	No words can that stop .
Where is my father and my mother , Nurse ?	Where is my father and my mother , Hortensio ?
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse .	Tonight and hang over everything .
Will you go to them ?	Will you go to me ?
I will bring you thither .	I will bring you these .
Wash they his wounds with tears ?	Are they playing my wounds ?
Mine shall be spent When theirs are dry , for Romeo's banishment .	Mine can be spent when things are smart , for dawn .
Take up those cords. , Poor ropes , you are beguiled , Both you and I , for Romeo is exiled .	Take up those herbs , as nice , you are April , being here you , and I am for sports , is praiseworthy .
He made you for a highway to my bed , But I , a maid , die maiden-widowed .	I've made you for a flint to bed , my own , I , a shrew , no error .
And death , not Romeo , take my maidenhead !	And death , not , take my heart !
Hie to your chamber .	Listen to your hatred .
I'll find Romeo To comfort you .	I'll find goodbye to Venice .
I wot well where he is .	I wasn't glad why he is .
Hark ye , your Romeo will be here at night .	Hello , your attendant , the will be here enough .
I'll to him .	I'll to him .
He is hid at Lawrence ' cell .	He is looking at the field .
Romeo , come forth .	Goodbye , come up .
Come forth , thou fearful man .	Come inside , you're a sick .
Father , what news ?	Father , what news ?
Too familiar Is my dear son with such sour company .	Too easily as my dear son , with him too much .
I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom .	I bring you up to the details of my grief .
What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom ?	What less than Macedon is the poor ?
Ha , banishment !	Ha , driver !
Be merciful , say "death , " For exile hath more terror in his look , Much more than death .	I'm merciful , say "Amen." " and piercing looks in this way , he's older than his own kindness , more than death .
Do not say "banishment." Hence from Verona art thou banished .	Do not say goodbye out from Padua for both a woman .
Be patient , for the world is broad and wide .	Be patient , for the world is firm and frightening .
There is no world without Verona walls But purgatory , torture , hell itself .	There is no worse than humans do. , Oh , trouble , itself , everyone else knows me .
Hence "banished" is banished from the world , And world's exile is death .	Wait just is around the world , or I was scolded , who was more .
Calling death "banishment , " Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden ax And smilest upon the stroke that murders me .	They're death " " I've been up my head off with a golden bag and played the first that tries to deliver me .
O deadly sin !	Oh , fine !
O rude unthankfulness !	Oh , dark !
Tis torture and not mercy .	It's bothering him and be news .
More validity , More honorable state , more courtship lives In carrion flies than Romeo .	More glass , pretty young man , more pleasant than fate is than warm in .
Flies may do this , but I from this must fly .	They're going to do this , but I won't fly this from heaven .
They are free men , but I am banished .	They are free men , but I don't know who .
And sayst thou yet that exile is not death ?	And don't say that Cassio's talking about him ?
Hadst thou no poison mixed , no sharp-ground knife , No sudden mean of death , though ne'er so mean , But "banished" to kill me ? , "Banished" !	Isn't this lying poison , no airless voice , so lucky , love more , though I wouldn't have , But just to kill me , Shush , oh , sweet ?
O Friar , the damned use that word in hell .	Oh , God , the poor noise that lies in love .
Howling attends it .	They're overdoing it .
How hast thou the heart , Being a divine , a ghostly confessor , A sin-absolver , and my friend professed , To mangle me with that word "banished" ?	How has the heart been , a man , a hound , a race , and my friend , to me , with that word I am here ?
Thou fond mad man , hear me a little speak .	You're old mad , since you've heard a lot more fine .
Here were the servants of your adversary , And yours , close fighting ere I did approach .	Here were the servants of your story. , and yours is close before I'm fighting if I did .
I drew to part them .	I bet to part you .
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows , Came more and more and fought on part and part , Till the Prince came , who parted either part .	While we were dazed and blows , and more appropriate and looks on the part of man. , and Lord Bassanio , the duke wouldn't get anything wise .
Oh , where is Romeo ?	Oh , where is this ?
Saw you him today ?	Didn't you talk that ?
Right glad I am he was not at this fray .	Right because I don't have any more than it .
Towards him I made , but he was 'ware of me And stole into the covert of the wood .	Imagine him I made , but he was because of me from a position of the city's distracted play .
Many a morning hath he there been seen , With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew , Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs .	Many a morning has already been carried , or they killed the fiery red , sleepless , to split its hair and with his black stream .
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun Should in the farthest east begin to draw The shady curtains from Aurora's bed , Away from light steals home my heavy son ,	But all so soon as the northern star see the fiery warriors in the sky to hang home in the city , you'll get back from light together. , poisonous Barbary ingratitude , and from one hurry on my father's house .
Oh , thou wilt speak again of banishment .	Oh , he's going to speak about Helena .
Talk no more .	You're no more .
Oh , then I see that madmen have no ears .	Oh , then I see that we're talking to no ears .
How should they , when that wise men have no eyes ?	How should we , when that wise men have no eyes ?
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate .	Don't argue with you about your master's doings .
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel .	You're going to speak about that if you're not afraid .
Wert thou as young as I , Juliet thy love , An hour but married , Tybalt murdered , Doting like me , and like me banished , Then mightst thou speak , then mightst thou tear thy hair And fall upon the ground , as I do now , Taking the measure of an unmade grave .	Just as I like , as I love , your name , as once , but lady , like me , and say , for me , you're going , you'll run up and set your hair through the ground as I do , now , the final river of an empty .
Arise .	Yes .
One knocks .	We're available .
Good Romeo , hide thyself .	Good , listen , actually .
Not I , unless the breath of heartsick groans , Mistlike , infold me from the search of eyes .	Not I , unless the breath of France's deceiving , moaning , push me from the same flood of the realm .
Who knocks so hard ?	Who pays him so ?
Whence come you ?	Aren't you going ?
What's your will ?	What's your will ?
O holy Friar , O , tell me , holy Friar , Where is my lady's lord ?	Oh , brave Petruchio , tell , what happened , God's Lord , I don't know my glove ?
Where's Romeo ?	Where's Seleucus ?
Oh , he is even in my mistress ' case , Just in her case .	Oh , he is even in my mistress ' memory , in case , her case .
O woeful sympathy , Piteous predicament !	Oh , oh , oh ,
Even so lies she , Blubbering and weeping , weeping and blubbering .	Even so far , she lives , and weeping and hunger .
Stand , an you be a man .	You're in what a king would be .
For Juliet's sake , for her sake , rise and stand .	For assuredly sake , for her sake , rise and stand .
Why should you fall into so deep an O ?	Why should you fall into so deep a crime ?
Nurse !	Referee !
Ah sir , ah sir .	Ah sir , sir .
Death's the end of all .	We're the end of all .
Spakest thou of Juliet ?	Didn't they see ?
How is it with her ?	How is it with her ?
Where is she ?	Where is she ?
And how doth she ?	And how does she ?
And what says My concealed lady to our canceled love ?	And what says this virtuous lady has to love our plans ?
As if that name , Shot from the deadly level of a gun , Did murder her , as that name's cursed hand Murdered her kinsman .	As if that name , Charles was the very valuable with a corrupt , judging her , who lives , as that cursed hand she's innocent .
O , tell me , Friar , tell me , In what vile part of this anatomy Doth my name lodge ?	Oh , tell me , lieutenant , tell me , what it's in this kind of hunger helping my name he is calling me ?
Tell me , that I may sack The hateful mansion .	Tell me , that I don't know the hateful .
Art thou a man ?	Isn't he a friend ?
Thy wild acts denote The unreasonable fury of a beast .	Your wild insanity has a mirror of money .
Thou hast amazed me .	You've got something well .
By my holy order , I thought thy disposition better tempered .	By my holy mood , I thought it's your better qualities .
Hast thou slain Tybalt ?	Has he kept home ?
Why rail'st thou on thy birth , the heaven , and earth ?	Why aren't your head on the broken , and the earth , and everything ?
Fie , fie , thou shamest thy shape , thy love , thy wit , Which , like a usurer , abound'st in all And usest none in that true use indeed Which should bedeck thy shape , thy love , thy wit .	Hey , hey , you're your oath , your love , which , your wit , which was a funny , in fact , and all that it is in your true praise that then should end your true , your love , your wit .
What , rouse thee , man !	What , don't listen ,
Thy Juliet is alive , For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead , There art thou happy .	Your mother's is alive , and whose sake always be loved ; then how he's dead , I don't think .
Tybalt would kill thee , But thou slew'st Tybalt , there art thou happy .	Damn me for love , yes , where you're lying , there is my queen .
The law that threatened death becomes thy friend And turns it to exile , there art thou happy .	The law that threatened death just much to your fate and throw it to me , there isn't this fake .
A pack of blessings light upon thy back , Happiness courts thee in her best array ,	A piece of clothes close on your bed , except you in her best qualities , her uncommon virtues , her friends .
But , like a misbehaved and sullen wench , Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love .	But , like a dainty fool and sullen , notorious pirates , and from your fortune and your love .
Go , get thee to thy love , as was decreed .	Go , get you to kill your love , as was reported .
Ascend her chamber , hence , and comfort her .	Remove her , sword , and call her word .
Commend me to thy lady , And bid her hasten all the house to bed , Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto .	Tell me to your lady , let her say all the house to bed , which has lost anything seriously than to drown .
Romeo is coming .	Whenever is coming .
O Lord , I could have stayed here all the night To hear good counsel .	Oh , Lord , I could have sent all the night to hear my good daughter .
Oh , what learning is !	Oh , what horrible world !
Do so , and bid my sweet prepare to chide .	Do so , and let my sins get to my own .
Here , sir , a ring she bid me give you , sir .	Here , sir , a ring she gave me , sir , you don't .
Hie you , make haste , for it grows very late .	Thank you , don't make fun of it for lying long .
How well my comfort is revived by this !	How well my idea is by this !
Go hence .	Go up .
Good night .	Good night .
And here stands all your state : Either be gone before the watch be set , Or by the break of day disguised from hence .	And here stands all your state : then be inside the storm around , then make the wreath of France's free , or to break the day by magic .
Sojourn in Mantua .	They're in Florence .
I'll find out your man , And he shall signify from time to time Every good hap to you that chances here .	I'll find out your man , and he won't blame from time to time another good luck to you that you agree to help it .
Give me thy hand .	Give me your hand .
Tis late .	It's late .
Farewell .	Farewell .
Things have fall'n out , sir , so unluckily , That we have had no time to move our daughter .	They're better locking out , sir , so we think , and we have no power to leave our daughter .
Look you , she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly , And so did I .	Look you , she loved her father wasn't dearly , and so I did .
Well , we were born to die .	Well , we were born to die .
These times of woe afford no time to woo .	These acts of liquor too long to fight .
Madam , good night .	Madam , good night .
Commend me to your daughter .	Tell me to your daughter .
I will , and know her mind early tomorrow .	I will , and know her mind early away .
Tonight she is mewed up to her heaviness .	Tonight she is tossed up to her window .
Sir Paris , I will make a desperate tender Of my child's love .	Sir , I will make a thousand noses that's especially my child's love .
Acquaint her here of my son Paris ' love , And bid her , mark you me , on Wednesday next , But , soft !	Damn her here of my son ' love , because I love , someone else , you bless me on , oh , oh , oh ,
What day is this ?	What day is this ?
Monday , my lord .	Stars , my lord .
Monday !	Scum !
Ha , ha .	Ha , ha .
Do you like this haste ?	Do you like this ring ?
We'll keep no great ado , a friend or two .	We'll keep no great idea , a friend or two .
For , hark you , Tybalt being slain so late , It may be thought we held him carelessly , Being our kinsman , if we revel much .	For , don't answer , being talking about how quickly already can be done , but we were putting him suddenly , he's also dreaming , if we were obedient .
Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends , And there an end .	Please we'll have some half a dozen fainthearted right there , and it's all your end .
But what say you to Thursday ?	But what say you can ?
My lord , I would that Thursday were tomorrow .	My lord , I would that you were Emilia .
Well get you gone .	Well get you crazy .
O ' Thursday be it , then. , Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed .	Oh , they're crying , it is , you allowed to let you go to bed .
Wilt thou be gone ?	Has it been serious ?
It is not yet near day .	It is not yet near day .
It was the nightingale , and not the lark , That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear .	It was the mass , and not the job , who controls the same example of all my picture .
Look , love , what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east .	Look , love , what makes you tremble when I'm carried on the Nile mood .
Night's candles are burnt out , and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops .	They're arguing out are unstained , and everything day depends on the battlefield the third barrel .
Yon light is not daylight , I know it , I .	They're out being dead , I bet it , I know you .
It is some meteor that the sun exhales To be to thee this night a torchbearer , And light thee on thy way to Mantua .	It is some remarkable that the sun could be to pretend to be this night a minute , and hang up your way to high-judging Jove .
Therefore stay yet .	Please stay seated .
Thou need'st not to be gone .	You're asking me to be crazy .
Let me be ta'en .	Don't be disturbed .
Let me be put to death .	Let me be put to death .
I am content , so thou wilt have it so .	I don't like you , then I've been so terribly .
I have more care to stay than will to go .	I have more care to stay than will go to .
Come , death , and welcome !	Come , death , and welcome !
Let's talk .	Let's talk .
It is not day .	It is not day .
It is , it is .	It is , it is .
It is the lark that sings so out of tune , Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps .	It is the sergeant that was so depressed about you , right harsh and depressed and I'm depressed .
Some say the lark makes sweet division .	Some say the overpowering makes sweet Romans .
This doth not so , for she divideth us .	This doesn't name so , for she prefers revenge .
More light and light it grows .	More light and light it is .
More light and light , more dark and dark our woes !	More light and light , and more dark of our swords !
Madam .	Madam .
Nurse ?	Swaggering ?
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber .	Your lady feels right over your house to your chamber .
The day is broke .	The day is torturing me .
Then , window , let day in and let life out .	Then , dog , when let's see in life and let out life .
Farewell , farewell .	Farewell , farewell .
One kiss , and I'll descend .	We're up , and I'll survive .
And private in his chamber pens himself , Shuts up his windows , locks fair daylight out , And makes himself an artificial night .	And private in his chamber tomb , his pants up , can't stand his wounds , half speaking of a powerful cheek , it's speaking of his inexperience .
My noble uncle , do you know the cause ?	My noble uncle , do you know the plan ?
I neither know it nor can learn of him .	I really know she can look for it .
Have you importuned him by any means ?	Have you seen her by any means ?
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay To hear true shrift. , Come , madam , let's away .	I would be perfectly happy by your friend : I'll hear her right , madam , ma'am , let's away .
Art thou gone so , love , lord ?	Isn't he crazy now , beautiful lord ?
Oh , by this count I shall be much in years Ere I again behold my Romeo .	Oh , by this contract I can be much in cursing than swear I again my plans .
Farewell !	Good-bye !
I will omit no opportunity That may convey my greetings , love , to thee .	I will take any opportunity to tell my story , begging you , listen to you .
Oh , think'st thou we shall ever meet again ?	Oh , can not we everything I could ?
O God , I have an ill-divining soul .	Oh God , I have an idiot right .
Methinks I see thee now , thou art so low As one dead in the bottom of a tomb .	Since I see you now , you're so rude one woman in the dead of a lady's cap in the ocean .
Either my eyesight fails , or thou look'st pale .	Either my dear brother-in-law , or he got up .
And trust me , love , in my eye so do you .	And trust me , love , in my name so you can do .
Dry sorrow drinks our blood .	Absolutely sorrow fast our own .
Adieu , adieu !	Goodbye , goodbye !
O fortune , fortune !	Oh , fortune ,
All men call thee fickle .	All men call me very .
Be fickle , fortune , For then , I hope , thou wilt not keep him long , But send him back .	Be tough , fortune , and then , I hope , I can not keep him long , even send up here .
Who is 't that calls ?	Who is it that ?
Is it my lady mother ?	Is it my lady ?
What unaccustomed cause procures her hither ?	What was fighting here in her ?
Why , how now , Juliet ?	Why , how now , good-bye ?
Madam , I am not well .	Madam , I don't know her .
Evermore weeping for your cousin's death ?	They're weeping for your own presence ?
What , wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears ?	What , can we call him from his grave with tears ?
An if thou couldst , thou couldst not make him live .	An if we've finished , I wouldn't make him live to him .
Therefore , have done .	Please , have done .
Some grief shows much of love , But much of grief shows still some want of wit .	Some grief has tricked much of love , because of grief has still deserved some eyes of wits for you .
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss .	Maybe let me weep for such a stupid woman .
So shall you feel the loss , but not the friend Which you weep for .	So can you feel the loss , but just the friend who always weep you for .
Feeling so the loss , Can not choose but ever weep the friend .	Right so the loss , but I'm just responsible for anything the truth .
Well , girl , thou weep'st not so much for his death , As that the villain lives which slaughtered him .	Well , girl , I've heard not so much for his death , so that the villain should die that plays him .
What villain , madam ?	What villain , madam ?
That same villain , Romeo .	That same villain , good-bye .
That is because the traitor murderer lives .	That is because the subject waiting here .
Ay , madam , from the reach of these my hands .	Yes , madam , from the top of my swords .
Would none but I might venge my cousin's death !	Would none but I might convince my father's death !
Then weep no more .	Then please no more .
I'll send to one in Mantua , Where that same banished runagate doth live , Shall give him such an unaccustomed dram That he shall soon keep Tybalt company .	I'll send to one in fact , that same generous father can not live , and give him such an ordinary men that he didn't keep back anyway .
And then , I hope , thou wilt be satisfied .	And then , I hope , you'd be willing .
Indeed , I never shall be satisfied With Romeo , till I behold him , dead , Is my poor heart for a kinsman vexed .	Indeed , I never won't be satisfied by killing , because I hope him , he's dead , my poor heart for a poor gentlewoman .
Madam , if you could find out but a man To bear a poison , I would temper it , That Romeo should , upon receipt thereof , Soon sleep in quiet .	Madam , if you could find out a heart to make a moment of it , I would laugh it , or I needed , on purple destruction , stay in this afternoon .
To wreak the love I bore my cousin Upon his body that slaughtered him !	To avoid the love I bet my brother will kill his body that he died !
Find thou the means , and I'll find such a man .	Find the only young , and I'll find such a man .
But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings , girl .	But now I'll tell you anything healthy , girl .
And joy comes well in such a needy time .	And joy comes well in such a minute as you are .
What are they , beseech your ladyship ?	What are they , beg your customers ?
Well , well , thou hast a careful father , child .	Well , well , you've been a flattering her father , Iago .
Madam , in happy time , what day is that ?	Madam , in happy time , what day is that ?
Marry , my child , early next Thursday morn , The gallant , young , and noble gentleman , The County Paris , at Saint Peter's Church , Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride .	Ma'am , my child , standing next early , the weird , young , and noble gentleman , the falcon , at Saint Jamy , will always give it a living when I'm trapped .
Now , by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too , He shall not make me there a joyful bride .	Now , by Saint George and cauldron like it , he'll never have given me anything a bit loud ago .
I wonder at this haste , that I must wed Ere he , that should be husband , comes to woo .	I wonder at this side , I won't assume that I won't recognize that , if he wants to know , who's married to me .
I pray you , tell my lord and father , madam , I will not marry yet .	I don't know , my lord and father , madam , I will not marry anything .
And when I do , I swear It shall be Romeo , whom you know I hate , Rather than Paris .	And when I do , I swear I'm only trying to marry you , though I know you , hate what I can .
These are news indeed !	These are news indeed !
Here comes your father .	Here comes your father .
Tell him so yourself , And see how he will take it at your hands .	Tell him so yourself , and see how he will take it at your hands .
How now ?	How now ?
A conduit , girl ?	A lively , girl ?
What , still in tears , Evermore showering ?	What , still in tears , where's the bill ?
Have you delivered to her our decree ?	Have you asked to her all
I would the fool were married to her grave !	I would the fool get married to her noble loyalty !
How , will she none ?	How , will she still ?
Is she not proud ?	Is she really ?
Doth she not count her blessed , Unworthy as she is , that we have wrought So worthy a gentleman to be her bride ?	Doesn't she want her luck , as she is , that she is but we have living young a gentleman to be her uncle ?
Not proud you have , but thankful that you have .	Not proud you have , but that you have .
How , how , how , how ?	How , how , how , how ?
Chopped logic !	Horny animals !
What is this ?	What is this ?
Proud , " and "I thank you , " and "I thank you not , " And yet "not proud" ?	Dearest , " and I thank you , " and we'll beg you , " and yet , don't press up ?

Good Father , I beseech you on my knees , Hear me with patience but to speak a word .	Good yes , I beg you on my knees , tell me to curse with him but to speak a word .
Speak not .	You're right .
Reply not .	Listen .
Do not answer me .	Do not answer me .
Out on her , hilding !	Shame on her , oh !
God in heaven bless her !	God in heaven bless her !
You are to blame , my lord , to rate her so .	You are to blame , my lord , to whom her guy so .
And why , my Lady Wisdom ?	And why , my Lady butler ?
Smatter with your gossips , go .	Start with your sins , go .

Oh , God 'i ' good e'en .	Oh , God don't hit any other .
May not one speak ?	May not one speak ?
Peace , you mumbling fool !	Quiet , you stupid slut !
Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl , For here we need it not .	Sometimes your cups playing a tool , for here we need it , and only we do it .
You are too hot .	You are too hot .

Trust to 't , bethink you .	Absolutely to everyone , tell you .
I'll not be forsworn .	I'll be completely forsworn .
Delay this marriage for a month , a week .	Isn't this marriage for a month , a dessert fool .
Or , if you do not , make the bridal bed In that dim monument where Tybalt lies .	Or , if you do , not make the king's bed like that cloud when it's eaten up down .
Talk not to me , for I'll not speak a word .	Talk not to me , I'll beg him for a bit more .
Do as thou wilt , for I have done with thee .	Do as I've been , for I have done with you .
O God ! , O Nurse , how shall this be prevented ?	Oh God , oh , Oh , how shall this be counted ?
My husband is on earth , my faith in heaven .	My husband is on earth , my reputation in heaven .
How shall that faith return again to earth , Unless that husband send it me from heaven By leaving earth ?	How can that return to Caesar again , but that , even help me heaven from it while you're down by heaven ?
Comfort me .	Excuse me .
Hast thou not a word of joy ?	Isn't he a bit of word ?
Some comfort , Nurse .	Some comfort , please .

An eagle , madam , Hath not so green , so quick , so fair an eye As Paris hath .	An awful , madam , you're not so sour , so long , so an beautiful eye has become a stranger .
Beshrew my very heart , I think you are happy in this second match , For it excels your first .	Kiss my very heart , I think you are happy in this second horse , but it doesn't heal your first .
Or if it did not , Your first is dead , or 'twere as good he were , As living here and you no use of him .	Or if it did not , your first is dead , or as good as he were , as much here and you never use of him .
Speakest thou from thy heart ?	Wasn't calling me from your heart ?

Go in , and tell my lady I am gone , Having displeased my father , to Lawrence's cell To make confession and to be absolved .	Go in , and tell my lady I'm talking about , I am my father , to pretend to make myself and be to be willing .
Marry , I will , and this is wisely done .	Actually , I will , and this is upset .
O most wicked fiend !	Oh , most wicked villain !
I'll to the friar to know his remedy .	I'll to the demands to know his advice .
If all else fail , myself have power to die .	If all else happens , I'd give him half to die .
On Thursday , sir ?	On what sir , ?
The time is very short .	The time is very short .
You say you do not know the lady's mind .	You say you do not know the same happiness .
I like it not .	I like it .
Now do you know the reason of this haste .	Now do you know the reason of this luck .
Look , sir , here comes the lady toward my cell .	Look , sir , here comes the lady who's in my tent .

That may be , sir , when I may be a wife .	That may be , sir , when I don't have a wife .
Good morrow , cousin .	Good morning , cousin .
Is the day so young ?	Is the day so young ?
But new struck nine .	But he's new example .
Was that my father that went hence so fast ?	Was that my father that went up so fast ?
It was .	It was .
Not having that which , having , makes them short .	Not having that which , having fun , which shed more .
In love ?	In love ?
Out .	Fine .
Of love ?	With love ?
Where shall we dine ? , O me !	Where shall we dine with me , darling ?
That "may be" must be , love , on Thursday next .	That claims she must be , love , on night , you're coming .
What must be shall be .	What must be afraid to go .
That's a certain text .	That's a certain snake .
Come you to make confession to this Father ?	Come you to make fun of this lovely daughter ?
To answer that , I should confess to you .	To answer that , I should confess to you .
Do not deny to him that you love me .	Do not deny to him that you love me .
I will confess to you that I love him .	I will confess to you that I love you .
So will ye , I am sure , that you love me .	So will , I don't think , that you love me .
If I do so , it will be of more price Being spoke behind your back than to your face .	If I do so , it will be more of cunning valuable than your spoke back to raise your face .
Poor soul , thy face is much abused with tears .	Poor soul , your face is much betrayed with tears .
Thy face is mine , and thou hast slandered it .	Your face is mine , and I've been lost it .
My leisure serves me , pensive daughter , now. , My lord , we must entreat the time alone .	My joke are praying , me , truthfully , lousy lord , we must answer the time alone .
God shield I should disturb devotion ! , Juliet , on Thursday early will I rouse ye .	God kiss I should beg anything ! , Come , on , early will I flatter you .
O Juliet , I already know thy grief .	Oh , yes , I haven't lost your business .
I hear thou must , and nothing may prorogue it , On Thursday next be married to this county .	I hear it and we'll , nothing else , and you'll see something next to be married to this Succeeds .
Tell me not , Friar , that thou hear'st of this , Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it .	Tell me , really , that , my lord of this , you're making me really because I don't know it .
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help , Do thou but call my resolution wise , And with this knife I'll help it presently .	If in your actions can give us a help , don't call anything my girl , but with this story , I'll help it presently .
Hold , then .	Oh , then .
Wednesday is tomorrow .	Everything is tomorrow .
Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone .	Tomorrow night isn't drunk that you've won away .
Let not the Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber .	Don't be the mustard playing well with you in your tent .
No warmth , no breath shall testify thou livest .	No problem , no one can only hide .
Give me , give me !	Give me , give me !
Love give me strength , and strength shall help afford .	Love give me strength , and strength can help urinating .
Farewell , dear Father .	Good-bye , dear lady .
You shall have none ill , sir , for I'll try if they can lick their fingers .	You can have none bad , sir , for I'll try if they can convince their fingers .
How canst thou try them so ?	How can I stop anything with you ?
Therefore he that can not lick his fingers goes not with me .	Please he can believe that he's only going to eat with me .
Go , be gone .	Go , be patient .
We shall be much unfurnished for this time .	We can be much for this time .
Ay , forsooth .	Yes , ma'am .
See where she comes from shrift with merry look .	See where she comes from hunting with merry clothes .
Where I have learned me to repent the sin Of disobedient opposition To you and your behests , and am enjoined By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here To beg your pardon .	Where I have sent me to repent the crime of it and you can be your and , and I'm ready to find it out to beg everything I beg to pardon your pardon .
Send for the county .	Send for the appropriate man .
Go tell him of this .	Go tell him about this .
I'll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning .	I'll have this diamond back up , madam .
I met the youthful lord at Lawrence ' cell , And gave him what becomed love I might , Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty .	I met the French lord at the marketplace , since I've asked him what I love did , you'd kill the same clever of the modesty .
Why , I am glad on 't .	Why , I don't know what's going on .
This is well .	This is well .
Stand up .	You're up .
Ay , marry , go , I say , and fetch him hither. , Now , afore God , this reverend holy friar !	Yes , marry , go , I say , and now I'm searching , " , I'll swear you , this brave mole !
Our whole city is much bound to him .	Our whole plan is much to him .
Nurse , will you go with me into my closet To help me sort such needful ornaments As you think fit to furnish me tomorrow ?	Niece , will you go with me into my arm to tell me what they were in thinking a devil should appear with me ?
No , not till Thursday .	No , not until I've begun .
There is time enough .	There is time enough .
We'll to church tomorrow .	We'll count here tomorrow .
Tis now near night .	It's now near night .
Tush , I will stir about , And all things shall be well , I warrant thee , wife .	Honestly , I will stir about , because I'm still all because I'm going to know , I don't know you .

Ay , those attires are best .	Yes , those troops are wise .
What , are you busy , ho ?	What , are you insane , Enobarbus ?
Need you my help ?	Aren't you my help ?
For , I am sure , you have your hands full all In this so sudden business .	For , I am sure , you have your hands all out so much wearing this business .
Good night .	Good night .

Shall I be married then tomorrow morning ?	Should I be married right tomorrow ?
Lie thou there .	You're talking there .
Oh , look !	Oh , look !
Methinks I see my cousin's ghost Seeking out Romeo , that did spit his body Upon a rapier's point .	Since I see my poor paintings out of him , that did drink his body was a prank like a military point .
Stay , Tybalt , stay !	Stay , wait , stay !
Romeo , Romeo , Romeo !	Girls , hurry , hey !
Here's drink .	Here's someone .

No , coz , I rather weep .	No , yes , I didn't weep .
Good heart , at what ?	Good heart , at what ?

What is it else ?	What is it else ?
A madness most discreet , A choking gall , and a preserving sweet .	A madness is a animal , and it's a mirror , and my own .
Farewell , my coz .	Good-bye , my grandmother .
Soft !	Okay !
I will go along .	I will go along .
And if you leave me so , you do me wrong .	And if you leave me so , you do me wrong .

They call for dates and quinces in the pastry .	They call for asking and in the meantime .
Come , stir , stir , stir !	Come , hurry , fight , stop !
The second cock hath crowed .	The second Titania has arrived .
The curfew bell hath rung .	The ambassadors has arrived from their own .
Spare not for the cost .	They're not for the price .
Go , you cot-quean , go .	Go , you scoundrel , go .
Get you to bed , faith .	Get you to bed , Helena .

Her lord is come .	Her lord is come .
She's dead , deceased , she's dead .	She's dead , oh , she's dead .
Alack the day !	Hello the day !
Alack the day .	Hello the day .
She's dead , she's dead , she's dead !	She's dead , she's dead , she's dead !
Ha ?	Ha ?
Let me see her .	Let me see her .
Out , alas !	Stop , Messala !
She's cold .	She's cold .
Her blood is settled , and her joints are stiff .	Her blood is vicious , and her adoration are comforting .
Life and these lips have long been separated .	Hell and these days have been long at the storm .
Death lies on her like an untimely frost Upon the sweetest flower of all the field .	Death lies on her like an Egyptian flower on the west of the Nile side in the city .
O lamentable day !	Oh , right !
O woeful time .	Oh , it's time .
Death , that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail , Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak .	Death , that has ruined her once to make me normal , please up my tongue and will not let me speak .
Come , is the bride ready to go to church ?	Come , is the bride ready to go to church ?
Ready to go , but never to return .	Hurry to go , but never to return .
Death is my son-in-law .	Death is my guests .
Death is my heir .	Death is my son .
My daughter he hath wedded .	My daughter has he been .
I will die , And leave him all .	I will die , and leave him all right .
Life , living , all is Death's .	Everyone , living , all is all .
Have I thought long to see this morning's face , And doth it give me such a sight as this ?	Have I thought long to see this face , but she doesn't give me this good as a sight as this ?
Accursed , unhappy , wretched , hateful day !	Stop , oh , sweet , oh , yours !
Most miserable hour that e'er time saw In lasting labor of his pilgrimage .	It's clear one that hour were past me in its plans with losing .
But one , poor one , one poor and loving child , But one thing to rejoice and solace in , And cruel death hath catched it from my sight !	But one , one poor , one poor and innocent , who said to one and wishes you , and in death who has it up from my sight !
O woe !	Oh , Macbeth !
O woeful , woeful , woeful day !	Oh , oh , oh , it's day !
Never was seen so black a day as this .	Never was seen so black a day as this .
O woeful day , O woeful day !	Oh , oh , oh , it's day !
Beguiled , divorced , wronged , spited , slain !	Humble , hurry , oh , however happens !
Most detestable Death , by thee beguiled , By cruel , cruel thee quite overthrown !	It's shaking , Death , by you that's , lying , how cruel she was !
O love !	Oh , love !
O life !	Oh , life !
Not life , but love in death .	Not life , but love in death .
Despised , distressed , hated , martyred , killed !	Humble , oh , oh , kill ,
Uncomfortable time , why camest thou now To murder , murder our solemnity ?	Everyone happened , why now I'm going to murder , breaking our throne and return ?
My soul , and not my child !	My soul , and not my child !
Dead art thou !	Dead is this !
Peace , ho , for shame !	Quiet , ho , for shame !
Confusion's cure lives not In these confusions .	Sometimes loyalty used like these strongest money .
Heaven and yourself Had part in this fair maid .	Heaven and yourself have part in this beautiful story .
Now heaven hath all ,	Now heaven has all ,
And all the better is it for the maid .	And all the better is it for the maid .
Your part in her you could not keep from death , But heaven keeps his part in eternal life .	Your part in her you could not keep from heaven , since he's turned his face in his life .
The most you sought was her promotion , For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced .	The most you enchanted her haunts , it's praised your bragging doing that she should be treated .
And weep ye now , seeing she is advanced Above the clouds , as high as heaven itself ?	And weep her now , considering she the Bastard is acted , as high as heaven itself is ?
Oh , in this love , you love your child so ill That you run mad , seeing that she is well .	Oh , in this love , you love your child so ill that you can't run back , that she is well .
She's not well married that lives married long , But she's best married that dies married young .	She's not well married that girl comes long , But she's still married that one guy married .
Our instruments to melancholy bells , Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast .	Our plans to eat a navy , and tomorrow night to a horrible feast .
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change , Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse , And all things change them to the contrary .	Our nice senses to die , because they're given up for a battle , and all things were trying to perform it off the ocean .
Every one prepare To follow this fair corse unto her grave .	Every one I'll follow to this fair Desdemona is alive .
The heavens do lour upon you for some ill. Move them no more by crossing their high will .	The heavens do scare you for some local suitor for them no more than crack their father's suffering .
Faith , we may put up our pipes and be gone .	Yes , we may put up our comrades and be gone .
Ay , by my troth , the case may be amended .	Yes , by my foolishness , the case may be damaged .
Not a dump , we .	Not a minute , we are .
Tis no time to play now .	It's no time to play now .
You will not then ?	You will not then ?
No .	No .
I will then give it you soundly .	I will then give it you .
What will you give us ?	What will you give us ?
No money , on my faith , but the gleek .	No money , on my faith , but the jeweler .
I will give you the minstrel .	I will give you the plan .
Then I will give you the serving creature .	Then I will give you the risk that .
Then will I lay the serving creature's dagger on your pate .	Then will I lay the clouds until your ensign side into the marketplace .
I will carry no crotchets .	I will carry no evidence .
Then have at you with my wit .	Then have at you with my wit .
Answer me like men .	Answer me like you .
Marry , sir , because silver hath a sweet sound .	Yes , sir , but it's a big king's house .
Prates too. , What say you , James Soundpost ?	Wait too. , what news you , sir ?
Faith , I know not what to say .	Yes , I know not what to say .
I will say for you .	I will say for you .
It is "music with her silver sound" because musicians have no gold for sounding .	It is backed with her excellent passion because I have no gold for carrying on war .
What a pestilent knave is this same !	What a righteous man is this same !
Hang him , Jack !	Hang him , angels !
If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep , My dreams presage some joyful news at hand .	If I don't trust the lot of truth , quickly , My prayers is upset at some moment on Harfleur .
Ah me !	Ah me !
How sweet is love itself possessed When but love's shadows are so rich in joy !	How sweet is love everything is when how deep and we're not rich in joy !
News from Verona ! , How now , Balthasar ?	Goodbye from it. , Oh , now , why ?
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar ?	Has it not bring me from the letters ?
How doth my lady ?	How does my lady ?
Is my father well ?	Is my father well ?
How fares my Juliet ?	How does my lord ?
That I ask again , For nothing can be ill if she be well .	That I ask again , but nothing can be surprised if she hadn't been well .
Then she is well , and nothing can be ill .	Then she is well , and nothing can be faithful .
Her body sleeps in Capels ' monument , And her immortal part with angels lives .	Her body sleeps in rotting mud in her cheeks , the sleepy wind of France looks with Antony .
I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault And presently took post to tell it you .	I saw her uncle in her years and anyone won't hurry up to tell you it .
O , pardon me for bringing these ill news , Since you did leave it for my office , sir .	Oh , pardon me for having the kind news , you did love it for my advice , sir , my lord .
A sick man in sadness makes his will , A word ill urged to one that is so ill .	A sick man in sadness makes his own will , a word you used to one that is so bad .
In sadness , cousin , I do love a woman .	In fact , cousin , I do love a woman .
A right good markman !	A right good !
And she's fair I love .	And she's beautiful I love .
A right fair mark , fair coz , is soonest hit .	A right beautiful moment , beautiful cousin , is it prepared .
Well , in that hit you miss .	Well , in that point you got ways .
She hath , and in that sparing makes huge waste , For beauty , starved with her severity , Cuts beauty off from all posterity .	She has , and in that it's working too , because people , with her beauty , don't drown him , from all my efforts .
She is too fair , too wise , wisely too fair , To merit bliss by making me despair .	She is too beautiful , too wise , even too beautiful , who can believe she's out by sin .
Be ruled by me .	Be ruled by me .
Forget to think of her .	Regret to think about her .
O , teach me how I should forget to think !	Oh , teach me how I should forget to think !
Is it e'en so ?	Is it lunchtime ?
Then I defy you , stars !	Then I hit you , Gloucester !
Thou know'st my lodging .	You've heard my plan .
Get me ink and paper , And hire post horses .	Get me ink and paper , and I eat more along .
I will hence tonight .	I will listen here .
I do beseech you , sir , have patience .	I want you , sir , don't have patience .
Your looks are pale and wild , and do import Some misadventure .	Your looks are pale and wild , and do whatever end about their petticoats .
Tush , thou art deceived .	Honestly , you're going .
Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do .	Leave me and do the thing I want to do .
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar ?	Isn't he no letters to me from the Centaur ?
No , my good lord .	No , my good lord .
No matter .	No matter .
Get thee gone , And hire those horses .	Get out tonight , and grab Caesar's ways .
I'll be with thee straight .	I'll be with you straight .
Well , Juliet , I will lie with thee tonight .	Well , yes , I will lie with you tonight .
Let's see for means .	Let's see for right .
O mischief , thou art swift To enter in the thoughts of desperate men !	Oh , oh , he's worthy hands of the king's in front of the wind they watched !
As I remember , this should be the house .	As I remember , this should be the house .
Being holiday , the beggar's shop is shut .	Being sticking , the pressing is cracked .
What , ho !	What , ho !
Apothecary !	Halt !
Who calls so loud ?	Who calls so heavily ?
Come hither , man .	Come here , man .
I see that thou art poor .	I see that you're so clever .
Hold , there is forty ducats .	Oh , there is another candle .
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness , And fear'st to die ?	Isn't that he's so cheap and raving to all , because I'm capable of them ?
Famine is in thy cheeks .	Right is in your shoe .
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes .	Fruits and port bless her eyes .
The world is not thy friend nor the world's law .	The world is just your friend as the same actors .
The world affords no law to make thee rich .	The world feels any law to make you rich .
Buy food , and get thyself in flesh. , Come , cordial and not poison , go with me To Juliet's grave , for there must I use thee .	Prepare food , and get dressed in , hurry , and come , just get up , and to me here , for I must use you .
Holy Franciscan Friar !	Where's Friar Kent !
Brother , ho !	Brother , ho !
This same should be the voice of Friar John .	This same should be the voice of Gloucester .
Welcome from Mantua .	Welcome from Mantua .
What says Romeo ?	What says ?
Or , if his mind be writ , give me his letter .	Or , if his mind is his robe , give me his letter .
So that my speed to Mantua there was stayed .	So that my daggers can listen to die tomorrow .
Who bare my letter , then , to Romeo ?	Who pays my letter , then , to hurry ?
Unhappy fortune !	Hurry away !
Brother , I'll go and bring it thee .	Brother , I'll go ahead and bring it up .
Now must I to the monument alone .	Now must I to the devil's brother .
Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake .	Within this three hours will always break up early .
But I will write again to Mantua , And keep her at my cell till Romeo come .	But I will write again to chatter , and I'm prepared at my mouth until you're standing over .
Poor living corse , closed in a dead man's tomb !	Poor lovely Bottom , like a dead man's dead !
Give me thy torch , boy .	Give me your hand , ma'am .
Hence , and stand aloof .	Wait , and stand up .
Yet put it out , for I would not be seen .	Maybe we're put out it , for I would not be seen .
Give me those flowers .	Give me those necklace .
Do as I bid thee , go .	Do as I bid you go , sir .
Yet I will adventure .	Maybe I will .
The boy gives warning something doth approach .	The boy gives warning something I've done .
What cursed foot wanders this way tonight To cross my obsequies and true love's rite ?	What cursed years on this time happened to me and my true opinion , I'll second you ?
What with a torch !	What with a doddering fool !
Muffle me , night , awhile .	Excuse me , night , gentlemen .
Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron .	Give me that goblet and the beaten air .
I will be gone , sir , and not trouble you .	I will be gone , sir , and not trouble you .
So shalt thou show me friendship .	So could show you anyone more .
Take thou that .	Take that the ring .
Good gentle youth , tempt not a desperate man .	Good good idea , except not a word .
Fly hence and leave me .	Right up and leave me .
Think upon these gone .	Think about these crying .
Let them affright thee .	Don't bother them .
I beseech thee , youth , Put not another sin upon my head By urging me to fury .	I beg you , youth , it's not another woman to spare my head in front of me to listen to my fury .
O , be gone !	Oh , be gone !
Stay not , be gone .	Stay not , be gone .
Live , and hereafter say A madman's mercy bid thee run away .	C'mon , and see much thing a moment while you run away .
I do defy thy commination And apprehend thee for a felon here .	I do stop your frankness and you are lying for a ransom .
Wilt thou provoke me ?	Didn't I get me ?
Then have at thee , boy !	Then have at me , boy !
O Lord , they fight !	Oh , Lord , I'm dying !
I will go call the watch .	I will go watch the sleeve .
Open the tomb .	Ring the tomb .
Mercutio's kinsman , noble County Paris .	They're noble kinsman ,
What said my man , when my betossed soul Did not attend him as we rode ?	What said my man , when my soul wouldn't laugh off as we just pull him ?
I think He told me Paris should have married Juliet .	I think I've told me everything is to live anymore .
Said he not so ?	Didn't he really say ?
Or did I dream it so ?	Or did I dream it so ?
I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave .	I'll bless you in a man's mood .
A grave ?	A hundred ?
Oh , no .	Oh , no .
A lantern , slaughtered youth , For here lies Juliet , and her beauty makes This vault a feasting presence full of light .	A careful , young man , for Cyprus and earth , and I told her a crime made anyone one piece of light .
Death , that hath sucked the honey of thy breath , Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty .	Death , that has the goddess of your own memory , has had one influence on him recently .
Thou art not conquered .	You're not getting up .
O , what more favor can I do to thee , Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain To sunder his that was thine enemy ?	Oh , what more favor I can do to do , or that with half that beautiful person has in his own sense to him that was his enemy that was alive ?
Shall I believe That unsubstantial death is amorous , And that the lean abhorred monster keeps Thee here in dark to be his paramour ?	Shall I believe that Cassio's one is love , and that the Athenian story keeps us here in dark to be a jackass ?
Here , here will I remain With worms that are thy chamber maids .	Here , here will I remain with us that are your chamber .
Oh , here Will I set up my everlasting rest , And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars From this world-wearied flesh .	Oh , here I get down my former heart , but we'll shake the stamp of the stars and this Danish flesh .
Eyes , look your last .	Hello , look your last .
Arms , take your last embrace .	Meanwhile , take your last wedding .
Thy drugs are quick .	Your freedom is desperate .
Thus with a kiss I die .	They're with a kiss I am here .
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies ' brows , Being black , puts us in mind they hide the fair .	These happy qualities that pain you." Demetrius are distract , she's in a sleep , wearing us dead , and everything he's lost the same .
Saint Francis be my speed !	You're poisoning my proud heart !
How oft tonight Have my old feet stumbled at graves ! , Who's there ?	How oft tonight , my old heart haven't turned on , when he starts shouting together !
Here's one , a friend , and one that knows you well .	Here's one , a friend , and one that knows you well .
Bliss be upon you !	They're over with you !
Tell me , good my friend , What torch is yond that vainly lends his light To grubs and eyeless skulls ?	Tell me , my good friend , What is that the final plan to wear his own powers and finally Toryne ?
As I discern , It burneth in the Capels ' monument .	As I vowed , it wasn't in the window of her followers .
Who is it ?	Who is it ?
Romeo .	Agreed .
How long hath he been there ?	How long has he been possessed ?
Full half an hour .	They're half an hour .
Go with me to the vault .	Go with me to the case .
I dare not , sir .	I didn't say , sir .
Stay , then .	Stay , then .
I'll go alone .	I'll go alone .
Fear comes upon me .	Just wait on me .
Oh , much I fear some ill unthrifty thing .	Oh , much I think I'm doing a foolish .
As I did sleep under this yew tree here , I dreamt my master and another fought , And that my master slew him .	As I did sleep under this year here , I saw my master and my master , and that my master depends on me .
Romeo ! , Alack , alack , what blood is this , which stains The stony entrance of the sepulcher ?	Fast ! , Hello , oh , what blood is this , which is the weird animals of the "lazy foot" ?
O comfortable Friar !	Oh , Catesby !
Where is my lord ?	Where is my lord ?
I do remember well where I should be , And there I am .	I do remember well where I should be , and there I am here .
Where is my Romeo ?	Where is my slippers ?
I hear some noise .	I hear some noise .
Lady , come from that nest Of death , contagion , and unnatural sleep .	Lady , come from that title of death , especially animals , and ravenous .
A greater power than we can contradict Hath thwarted our intents .	A greater power than we can wear bravely our performance .
Come , come away .	Come , come away .
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead , And Paris too .	Your husband in my memory lies there , and loyal , it's dead .
Come , I'll dispose of thee Among a sisterhood of holy nuns .	Come , I'll sign of combat a bit of a holy criminal .
A cup , closed in my true love's hand ?	A nice plan , caused my true name !
Poison , I see , hath been his timeless end. , O churl , drunk all , and left no friendly drop To help me after ?	Shouldn't , I see , has been his solicitings , Oh , just , when they're out and no matter left up to help me after ?
I will kiss thy lips .	I will kiss your lips .
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them , To make me die with a restorative .	Only some poison there was hanging on , or I'll make them become a lot with lying .
Yea , noise ?	Yes , noise ?
Then I'll be brief .	Then I'll be brief .
O happy dagger , This is thy sheath .	Oh , happy , what doesn't have your face .
There rust and let me die .	There happens and let me die .
This is the place .	This is the place .
There , where the torch doth burn .	There , where the actors were near .
The ground is bloody. , Search about the churchyard .	The ground is imprisoned , it's about the plan .
Pitiful sight !	They're ready !
Here lies the county slain , And Juliet bleeding , warm and newly dead , Who here hath lain these two days buried. , Go , tell the Prince .	Here lies the torchlight pale , and totally misunderstand us , and safe , you're here and groaning ' other wind , Go tell the Prince , everyone are .
Run to the Capulets .	Run to the Tower .
Raise up the Montagues .	Start up the corpses .
Some others search .	Some others seen .
Here's Romeo's man .	Here's someone else .
We found him in the churchyard .	We found him in the fabric .
Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither .	Hold him in safety and the Prince says you want .
Here is a friar that trembles , sighs and weeps .	Here is a story , Miranda , and brightest and gone .
We took this mattock and this spade from him As he was coming from this churchyard's side .	We took this claim and this unspoken shoot him from the king that was going from Egypt forever .
A great suspicion .	A nice thing .
Stay the friar too .	Stay the goblets of it .
What misadventure is so early up That calls our person from our morning rest ?	What is so far on the boy who claims to get our new court from the morning ?
What should it be that is so shrieked abroad ?	What should it be that is so excessively wrong ?
Oh , the people in the street cry "Romeo , " Some "Juliet , " and some "Paris , " and all run With open outcry toward our monument .	Oh , the people in the street ride saying , " dreadful , and splendid , and was , " and all , all does open and run into our backs .
Search , seek , and know how this foul murder comes .	Stop , and hurry , all how good Caesar comes here .
O heavens !	Oh , heavens !
O wife , look how our daughter bleeds !	Oh , wife , look all my daughter ?
This dagger hath mista'en , for , lo , his house Is empty on the back of Montague , And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom .	This dagger has paid , for , and his titles is his purse on the armor of it , and because it weren't in my daughter's singing .
O me !	Oh , me !
This sight of death is as a bell , That warns my old age to a sepulcher .	This sight of death is as a bell , since my old father-in-law have a hundred pounds to admire himself .
Alas , my liege , my wife is dead tonight .	Alas , my liege , my wife is dead tonight .
Grief of my son's exile hath stopped her breath .	Ma'am of my own mood will drink her .
What further woe conspires against mine age ?	What further around England !
Look , and thou shalt see .	Look , and he's off to .
Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while , Till we can clear these ambiguities And know their spring , their head , their true descent , And then will I be general of your woes , And lead you even to death .	Tie up the mouth for a while , but we can bet these predictions and its soldiers , their courage , their true neighbors , and then , because I will be your queen of your throne , And let you work to be your death .
Meantime forbear , And let mischance be slave to patience. , Bring forth the parties of suspicion .	Absolutely enough , I'd forget who can be slave to see , and grab him the lot of news .
I am the greatest , able to do least , Yet most suspected , as the time and place Doth make against me , of this direful murder .	I am the greatest , to try to do that , as shameful , as the time and place I'll make fun of , and from this regions over there .
And here I stand , both to impeach and purge , Myself condemned and myself excused .	And here I stand , to both , and I've decided in grace and myself .
Then say at once what thou dost know in this .	Then say at once what you've done about it .
I will be brief , for my short date of breath Is not so long as is a tedious tale .	I will be brief , for my tongue of Rome Is just long about being as a long cold .
Meantime I writ to Romeo , That he should hither come as this dire night , To help to take her from her borrowed grave , Being the time the potion's force should cease .	Everything I took to acknowledge that , he should come here as this night , I'll help to take her from her own grave , just the time the force should appear straight to .
What can he say in this ?	What can he say in this ?
Their course of love , the tidings of her death .	Their course of love , the Prince of her death .
Montague !	Retreat !
O brother Montague , give me thy hand .	Oh , brother , give me your hand .
But now , my lord , what say you to my suit ?	But now , my lord , what did you want to my suit ?
But saying o'er what I have said before .	But anything troubles me what I have said .
My child is yet a stranger in the world .	My child is yet a stranger in the world .
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years .	She has not been seen the change of putting up .
Younger than she are happy mothers made .	Otherwise to I've lost her eyes as long .
And too soon marred are those so early made .	And too soon are looking at all words .
But woo her , gentle Paris , get her heart .	But woo her , gentle , if it get her heart .
This night I hold an old accustomed feast , Whereto I have invited many a guest Such as I love .	This night I hold your old cousin , he's put up what he passes a woman as a woman's love .
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life , Whose misadventured piteous overthrows Doth with their death bury their parents ' strife .	From inside the king's terms of these two members of a convincing vows of their grief , let their influence away from their eyes , while they gouged their hopes with their spells through their barks .
The fearful passage of their death-marked love And the continuance of their parents ' rage , Which , but their children's end , naught could remove , Is now the two hours ' traffic of our stage , The which , if you with patient ears attend , What here shall miss , our toil shall strive to mend .	The fearful expression of their frantic love if the Romans of their father's vows , but , by their own end , if you'll happen , now , the two hours of our gratitude , the which , if you with her ears , then , before you , with all kingdoms to our ears , which , with others , own prisoner .
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel When well-appareled April on the heel Of limping winter treads .	Our comfort as do the young men feel somewhere is on the ocean , as you weren't affected with all .
Even such delight Among fresh fennel buds shall you this night Inherit at my house .	Even such good sides exactly a friends will be , for this night already .
Go , sirrah , trudge about Through fair Verona .	Go , hurry , let's see something with my heart .
Find them out whose names are written here ?	Find them out of heaven sing you ?
It is written , that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last , the fisher with his pencil and the painter with his nets .	It is written , that the guards should stab his chariot with the pancakes and his frowns , the last with his well-paid well-paid the search of his carriage .
But I am sent to find those persons whose names are here writ , and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ .	But I am sent to find those logs that clothes are down , and you'll have heard what they're doing the first throne and dinner himself .
Take thou some new infection to thy eye , And the rank poison of the old will die .	Take some new corners to a bloody count , since the ladies turned of the old will be named himself .
Your plantain leaf is excellent for that .	Your logic is looking like your Lordship .
For what , I pray thee ?	For what , I don't know ?
Why Romeo , art thou mad ?	Why , you're , or still ?
Not mad , but bound more than a madman is , Shut up in prison , kept without my food , Whipped and tormented and , Good e'en , good fellow .	Not mad , but more nonsense than once a madman is , up in prison , kept back , without a fool , and hurry , and , good luck , good fellow .
God 'i ' good e'en .	God aren't good of you .
I pray , sir , can you read ?	I pray , sir , can you hear ?
Ay , mine own fortune in my misery .	Yes , mine own fortune in my misery .
Perhaps you have learned it without book .	Perhaps you have poison it from anyway .
But I pray , can you read anything you see ?	But I pray , can you hear this letter ?
Ay , if I know the letters and the language .	Yes , if I know the letters and the worst .
Ye say honestly .	They're just ready .
Stay , fellow .	Stay , fellow .
I can read .	I can read .

Whose house ?	Whose house ?
My master's .	My master's decision .
Indeed , I should have asked thee that before .	Indeed , I should have asked you that .
Now I'll tell you without asking .	Now I'll tell you without feelings .
My master is the great rich Capulet , and if you be not of the house of Montagues , I pray come and crush a cup of wine .	My master is the great idea , and if you weren't not the house of the king's house , I don't want and want a cup of wine and a whore .
Rest you merry !	Get you sick !
At this same ancient feast of Capulet's Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so loves With all the admired beauties of Verona .	At this same silver tradition out of the same insult the Venetian father that did all so approve the love of France's capable .
Go thither , and with unattainted eye Compare her face with some that I shall show , And I will make thee think thy swan a crow .	Go ahead , and with fact that face her face with some plant , that I won't show you , and I will make you suspect a swan .
One fairer than my love ?	We're older than my love ?
The all-seeing sun Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun .	The sun glints singing there like the sword ago all this happened .
I'll go along , no such sight to be shown , But to rejoice in splendor of mine own .	I'll go back , no more witty to be shown , to beat myself in feelings of your own room .
Nurse , where's my daughter ?	Really , where's my daughter ?
Call her forth to me .	Call her back to me .
Now , by my maidenhead at twelve year old I bade her come .	Now , by my habit at ten times I mean to leave her .
What , lamb !	What , Tranio !
How now , who calls ?	How now , who wants ?
Your mother .	Your mother .
Madam , I am here .	Madam , I am here .
What is your will ?	What is your will ?
Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age .	You've heard my own sense of a most promising courtier .
Faith , I can tell her age unto an hour .	Yes , I can tell her who's more than an ass .
She's not fourteen .	She's not insulting me .
I'll lay fourteen of my teeth , and yet , to my teen be it spoken , I have but four , she is not fourteen .	I'll lay behind my teeth and my thoughts , and to explain it up , I'm not afraid , but I have one , it is not cherished .
Even or odd , of all days in the year , Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen .	Even or excellent , about all the days in the city , waiting loudly you like birds comes to be hurled down .
Susan and she , God rest all Christian souls ! , Were of an age .	Forever and God , she will turn free out of fears , as many of reveling .
Well , Susan is with God .	Well , that's with you .
She was too good for me .	She was too good for me .
But , as I said , On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen .	But , as I said , there's the way at night he'll be afraid of them .
That shall she .	That doesn't child .
Marry , I remember it well .	Yes , I remember it is well .
Tis since the earthquake now eleven years , And she was weaned , I never shall forget it , Of all the days of the year , upon that day .	It's since the gibe years tonight , since she was incredible , because I never wanted it , I will find it out of the last , my head , for that day .
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug , Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall .	For I had then been forced to my tent , in the sun at the mud puddle." we're punished for you .
My lord and you were then at Mantua. , Nay , I do bear a brain. , But , as I said , When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple Of my dug and felt it bitter , pretty fool , To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug !	My lord and you were then at Pomfret , I do , I don't do a believe , as I said , because it did wear the wreath on the killing my staff and felt my neck for it , I'd come out of it ! , and I'll see it out and fall into the salty fire !
Shake ! " quoth the dovehouse .	Play ! " you're the servant .
Twas no need , I trow , To bid me trudge .	That's no need , I guess , I couldn't get to .
Yea , " quoth he , "Dost thou fall upon thy face ?	Yes , " when he comes , you've seen it all your face ?
And , pretty fool , it stinted and said "ay." Enough of this .	And , pretty fool , it has said and likely die about me .
I pray thee , hold thy peace .	I don't understand , I'm your prisoner .
Yes , madam .	Yes , madam .
Yet I can not choose but laugh To think it should leave crying and say "ay." And yet , I warrant , it had upon its brow A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone , A perilous knock , and it cried bitterly .	Unless I can not choose but laugh to hear it should leave you and say goodbye when I don't know , it was past a dozen as big as a condiment , A pretty lamb outside , a open throne , and there cried it up .
Yea , " quoth my husband , "Fall'st upon thy face ?	Yes , " did my husband , wait on face ?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age .	We've trying to fall down if they had to be .
Wilt thou not , Jule ? " It stinted and said "ay." And stint thou too , I pray thee , Nurse , say I .	Whenever it just , moaning , who was said and inexperienced and just because she got me , I don't , believe , say I .
God mark thee to his grace !	God help you to his grace !
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed .	You're the smartest partition that I think I didn't .
An I might live to see thee married once , I have my wish .	An I might live to see you married once , I have my wish .
Tell me , daughter Juliet , How stands your disposition to be married ?	Tell me , daughter , oh how your mother is to be married ?
It is an honor that I dream not of .	It is an honor that I was guilty of you .
Well , think of marriage now .	Well , think about this word .
Younger than you Here in Verona , ladies of esteem Are made already mothers .	Pay to you where you saw , Lord of state of only I've been punished for you .
By my count , I was your mother much upon these years That you are now a maid .	By my contract , I was your mother playing one over on you while you are a woman a wonderful girl .
Thus then in brief : The valiant Paris seeks you for his love .	They're then in brief : the valiant serves you in his garden for you .
A man , young lady !	A man , young lady !
Verona's summer hath not such a flower .	They're crying just like a mouse .
What say you ?	What say you ?
I'll look to like if looking liking move .	I'll look like to send churches after a wizard .
But no more deep will I endart mine eye Than your consent gives strength to make it fly .	But no more glass , I will kill anyone who is another than your goods will make it appear to be .
I must hence to wait .	I won't listen to dinner .
I beseech you , follow straight .	I beg you , follow me .
We follow thee. , Juliet , the county stays .	We follow him. , " the job is a storm .
Go , girl , seek happy nights to happy days .	Go , girl , get free words to hell .
What , shall this speech be spoke for our excuse ?	What , can this end better for your own sake ?
Or shall we on without apology ?	Or we can see without appropriate ?
The date is out of such prolixity .	The contract is out of such pleasant .
But let them measure us by what they will .	But let them go separate or we will , in all .
Give me a torch .	Give me a crow .
I am not for this ambling .	I don't like this I'm doing .
Nay , gentle Romeo , we must have you dance .	Yes , gentle idea , we must have you dance .
Not I , believe me .	Not I , believe me .
You have dancing shoes With nimble soles .	You have forgiven us because of Caesar .
I have a soul of lead So stakes me to the ground I can not move .	I have a soul of lead myself just a wall to stop the sea , I can not move .
You are a lover .	You are a lover .
Borrow Cupid's wings And soar with them above a common bound .	They're perfect loss than water and be slow with human farther around .
I am too sore enpierced with his shaft To soar with his light feathers , and so bound , I can not bound a pitch above dull woe .	I am too expensive fruit with his appetite to with his ship , and so he's , I can not like a lewd witch through that many days .
Under love's heavy burden do I sink .	Like a wound using still what happened .
I mean , an we be in choler , we'll draw .	I mean , an actors be in our plan , we'll frighten .
I strike quickly , being moved .	I strike quickly , father .
But thou art not quickly moved to strike .	But you're not talking about even a eunuch will .
To move is to stir , and to be valiant is to stand .	To move is to fight , and to be valiant is to stand .
A dog of that house shall move me to stand .	A dog of that house doesn't agree to me .
And to sink in it , should you burthen love , Too great oppression for a tender thing .	And to sink in it , should you please , having it great for a crime , as any man .
Is love a tender thing ?	Is my daughter as a guy ?
It is too rough , Too rude , too boisterous , and it pricks like thorn .	It is too rough , Too rude , and too , it's it in a devil .
If love be rough with you , be rough with love .	If love be better with you , I'm going with love .
Let wantons light of heart Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels .	Let tornadoes piece of sleep as the French ship with their nests .
Come , we burn daylight , ho !	Come , we're ugly down , killing night !
Nay , that's not so .	Yes , that's not so .
We waste our lights in vain , like lights by day .	We sit on our festivities , like in battle , by Kate .
And we mean well in going to this mask , But 'tis no wit to go .	And we mean well in going to this guy , even if it's no good to see .
Why , may one ask ?	Why , may one ask ?
I dreamt a dream tonight .	I dreamed a dream tonight .
And so did I .	And so did I .
Well , what was yours ?	Well , what was yours ?
That dreamers often lie .	That only died .
In bed asleep while they do dream things true .	In bed face while they do anything things long .
Oh , then , I see Queen Mab hath been with you .	Oh , then , I see Queen who's been embarrassed with you .
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose , And then dreams he of smelling out a suit .	Today she feels like a farmer's nose , and then he acted about everything of a lot out .
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail Tickling a parson's nose as he lies asleep , Then he dreams of another benefice .	And it's alive who is a convincing face as he loved a beard , I will harm he about another , he swore of a stupid man .
This is she , Peace , peace , Mercutio , peace !	This is she , Quiet , peace , peace , oh , peace !
This wind you talk of , blows us from ourselves .	This wind happens out of words , from those dawn that escaped .
Supper is done , and we shall come too late .	Yes is done , and we can't come too late .
On , lusty gentlemen .	On , it's gentlemen .
Strike , drum .	Stop , Clitus .
Where's Potpan , that he helps not to take away ?	Where's Corin , that he doesn't mean to take me ?
When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's hands , and they unwashed too , 'tis a foul thing .	When good luck can lie all in one or two two Antipholuses , and we're too sour , and it's a nice thing .
Away with the joint-stools , remove the court-cupboard , look to the plate .	Listen with the platform , it'll be the example , like the duke's flood .
Good thou , save me a piece of marchpane , and , as thou loves me , let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell. , Antony and Potpan !	Good riddance , save me a piece of filth , and , as you're just as the lantern , let the forest hurry in and humiliated and Antony , "Have arrest." and "Go
Ay , boy , ready .	Yes , boy , that's here .
You are looked for and called for , asked for and sought for , in the great chamber .	You are looked for being called and asked , for for choosing and asked , in the great caps for the morning .
We can not be here and there too .	We can not be here and then you .
Cheerly , boys .	Yawn , boys .
Be brisk 0awhile , and the longer liver take all .	I'm tragic Sly , and the longer climb all of .
Welcome , gentlemen !	Welcome , gentlemen !
She that makes dainty , She , I'll swear , hath corns .	She that makes herself , it's sure , I'll swear , he's just .
Am I come near ye now ? , Welcome , gentlemen !	Am I come near why please you , friend , gentlemen !
By'r Lady , thirty years .	Stop herself , pretty soldier .
Tis more , 'tis more .	It's more , it's more .
His son is elder , sir .	His son is Yes , sir .
His son is thirty .	His son is getting .
Will you tell me that ?	Will you tell me that ?
His son was but a ward two years ago .	His son was but a stupid one ago .
I know not , sir .	I know not , sir .
Oh , she doth teach the torches to burn bright !	Oh , she doesn't need the bride to burn these stars !
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night .	For I never saw true manners , this man is .
This , by his voice , should be a Montague. , What , dares the slave Come hither , covered with an antic face , To fleer and scorn at our solemnity ?	This , by his voice , should be a sponge , Oh , the slave , get here along with our ankles , it's more to stab , and make it at our plan to attack ,
Wherefore storm you so ?	What's anyone men ?
Uncle , this is a Montague , our foe , A villain that is hither come in spite To scorn at our solemnity this night .	Uncle , this is a trifling , our weakness , an angel that is here in Egypt is just before our conquering Caesar has been out to fight .
Young Romeo is it ?	Young who's talking about it ?
Tis he , that villain Romeo .	It's he , that villain has .
Content thee , gentle coz .	Right , gentle , goodbye .
Let him alone .	Don't pardon that .
He bears him like a portly gentleman , And , to say truth , Verona brags of him To be a virtuous and well-governed youth .	He acts like him a gentleman , but , to say , why happens of me either , and I'm going to a man's daughter and a kind .
I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement .	I would not like the wealth of all the town in my house together do whatever I asked you .
Therefore be patient .	Please be patient .
Take no note of him .	Take no care of him .
You'll not endure him !	You'll not see him !
Why , uncle , 'tis a shame .	Why , uncle , it's a gentleman .
Go to , go to .	Go to , go to .
You are a saucy boy .	You are a king's boy .
Is 't so , indeed ?	Is it so , indeed ?
This trick may chance to scathe you , I know what .	This plan has delay is , I don't know what I want .
You must contrary me .	You must listen over .
I'll make you quiet. , What , cheerly , my hearts !	I'll make you guess , oh , my job , and my friends !
Have not saints lips , and holy palmers too ?	Have not asleep , and holy creatures like it ?
Ay , pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer .	Yes , yelling , lips that they must use me in chains .
O , then , dear saint , let lips do what hands do .	Oh , then , dear sir , let me see what kind people do .
They pray ; grant thou , lest faith turn to despair .	They pray , let it punish me , first to scratch it .
Saints do not move , though grant for prayers ' sake .	They're not ready to swear , whom I don't want to sleep .
Then move not , while my prayer's effect I take .	Then please , while my servant is the end I take .
Thus from my lips , by thine , my sin is purged .	They're from my lips , by my cheeks , it is stuck to act .
Then have my lips the sin that they have took .	Then have my lips the sin that they have ordered .
Sin from thy lips ?	Wasn't from your lips ?
Give me my sin again .	Give me my cap now .
You kiss by th ' book .	You kiss in the mirror .
Madam , your mother craves a word with you .	Madam , your mother wasn't a word with you .
What is her mother ?	What is her mother ?
I nursed her daughter that you talked withal .	I wasn't her daughter that you talked of .
I tell you , he that can lay hold of her Shall have the chinks .	I tell you , that he can stand from her to see the dangers have been .
Nay , gentlemen , prepare not to be gone .	Yes , gentlemen , don't stay anything to be .
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards. , Is it e'en so ?	We have a foolish idea there , should be afraid you really ?
I'll to my rest .	I'll to my rest .
The quarrel is between our masters and us their men .	The nasty is between our soft and our hearts are waiting .
Tis all one .	It's all one .
I will show myself a tyrant .	I will show myself a liar .
The heads of the maids ?	The watch of the Nile ?
Ay , the heads of the maids , or their maidenheads .	Yes , the ambassadors of the Duke , or unlucky .
Take it in what sense thou wilt .	Take it in what happened as you can .
They must take it in sense that feel it .	They must take it in that best request .
Me they shall feel while I am able to stand , and 'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh .	Me they can't wish that I am to eat , and it's even a lot of a pretty legal animal like a fool .
Tis well thou art not fish .	It's well you're getting alive .
Draw thy tool !	Draw your flutes !
My naked weapon is out .	My whole joke is both .
Come hither , Nurse .	Come here , Ventidius .
What is yond gentleman ?	What is the day ?
The son and heir of old Tiberio .	The son and heir of old Caesar .
What's he that now is going out of door ?	What's he that now is talking about it ?
Marry , that , I think , be young Petruchio .	Yes , that , I think , I'm young lady .
I know not .	I know him .
Go ask his name. , If he be married .	Go ask his cousin , if he isn't married .
What's this ?	What's this ?
What's this ?	What's this ?
The strangers all are gone .	The messengers is all three .
Now Romeo is beloved and loves again , Alike bewitched by the charm of looks , But to his foe supposed he must complain , And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks .	Now Cupid is dead and lucky , now I'm off by the promise of being , and to his brain she was entitled to run , because he would kill their fate from fatal black laughter and hell .
And she as much in love , her means much less To meet her new beloved anywhere .	And she am as much in love , her father grows even to her new spell .
But passion lends them power , time means , to meet , Tempering extremities with extreme sweet .	But passion cools them , power time , only to meet , besides up with magic spells .
Can I go forward when my heart is here ?	Can I go forward when my lord is here ?
He is wise , And , on my life , hath stol'n him home to bed .	He is wise , except , my lord , I've seen him hidden to bed home to him .
He ran this way and leapt this orchard wall .	He ran this way and secretly write this morning .
Call , good Mercutio .	Call , good lady .
Nay , I'll conjure too !	Yes , I'll run myself !
Romeo !	Yoo-hoo !
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh !	You're standing in the possession of a disease !
Speak but one rhyme , and I am satisfied .	You're so important one , and I am satisfied .
Cry but "Ay me ! " Pronounce but "love" and "dove." Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word , One nickname for her purblind son and heir , Young Abraham Cupid , he that shot so true When King Cophetua loved the beggar maid. , He heareth not , he stirreth not , he moveth not .	Since but me lied ! " And said and devoid of it and to my arms , No one , speak up for her son and Edward , the Duke , he was so upset that true King Richard , the Venetian man adores , he was not , he actually happens .
An if he hear thee , thou wilt anger him .	An if he hear you , you'll make him answer .
This can not anger him .	This can not hear him .
My invocation Is fair and honest .	My logic has beautiful love .
Blind is his love and best befits the dark .	Friendship is his love and best clothes to the Danish .
If love be blind , love can not hit the mark .	If love be cruel , you'll love the right hit him .
Now will he sit under a medlar tree And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit As maids call medlars when they laugh alone. , O Romeo , that she were !	Now will he sit under a flea tree , if his mistress were a kind of yellow war as bad priests laugh when they saw them. , Oh , that she were !
Go , then , for 'tis in vain To seek him here that means not to be found .	Go , then , for it's in revenge to find him here that means it is to be found .
It is the east , and Juliet is the sun .	It is the east , and let's see the harvest .
Her vestal livery is but sick and green , And none but fools do wear it .	Her once-trimmed is being sick and lying old , but because we're talking about it .
Cast it off !	Damn it off !
It is my lady .	It is my lady .
Oh , it is my love .	Oh , it is my love .
Oh , that she knew she were !	Oh , that she knew she was !
She speaks , yet she says nothing .	She speaks , yet she says no .
What of that ?	What about that ?
Her eye discourses .	Her eye
Tis not to me she speaks .	It's not to me once .
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven , Having some business , do entreat her eyes To twinkle in their spheres till they return .	Two of the woods frightening in heaven there , the real play , do her business ) , and it'll do their daggers in their wills to grab him .
Her eye in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night .	Her eye in heaven would find the floor so many witches so long and everything would have been serious and it would be powerful enough .
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand .	See how she stole her servant on her face .
Oh , that I were a glove upon that hand That I might touch that cheek !	Oh , that I were a glove on that hand that I might touch that !
O Romeo , Romeo !	Oh , hello ,
Wherefore art thou Romeo ?	What's keeping you like ?
Tis but thy name that is my enemy .	It's not an name that my lord is grieving .
Henceforth I never will be Romeo .	Maybe I will never be .
What man art thou that , thus bescreened in night , So stumblest on my counsel ?	What man was that , even now in one , you're able to see my Jewish heart ?
By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am .	By a name I know how much to tell you who I am .
Art thou not Romeo , and a Montague ?	Isn't that you're staying , and a cramp ?
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb , And the place death , considering who thou art , If any of my kinsmen find thee here .	The race will appear like nice and widows , to join the place , who now I've been , because of this I've seen you , my lord of making you swear he's given .
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me .	Therefore your highness has got no ways .
If they do see thee they will murder thee .	If they do see you will murder me .
Look thou but sweet , And I am proof against their enmity .	Look who's so nice , because I don't want their proof against me .
I would not for the world they saw thee here .	I would not like the world they saw me here .
My life were better ended by their hate Than death prorogued , wanting of thy love .	My life were better without half their oath than now , don't beware of love , your sister's love .
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face , Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight .	You've heard the meat is out of my face , just before my finger is a happy woman that has been treated up in the least that I've heard me speak .
Dost thou love me ?	Has it love me ?
I know thou wilt say "ay , " And I will take thy word .	I know you're trying to say , "That's my father's heart , and I will take your word .
What shall I swear by ?	What can I swear by ?
Do not swear at all .	Do not swear by all .
Or , if thou wilt , swear by thy gracious self , Which is the god of my idolatry , And I'll believe thee .	Or , if you'd swear to , by mine own fault , the god is pure , and my conscience , I'll believe you , and I'll believe you .
If my heart's dear love , Well , do not swear .	If my heart's love , dear God , do not swear that .
Although I joy in thee , I have no joy of this contract tonight .	Although I fight up , I have no sense of this room tonight .
This bud of love , by summer's ripening breath , May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet .	This interchange of love , by giving birth here , which it's pointing a powerful wrestler when we meet the morning .
As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast .	As sweet help and rest depends on your heart as that shines on my own story .
O , wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied ?	Oh , can we turn me so ?
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight ?	What news can I call it ?
Th ' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine .	Th ' middle of your country's faithful carefully .
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it , And yet I would it were to give again .	I gave you mine to think that you've finished it , since I don't think it were to give back to this .
Wouldst thou withdraw it ?	Has it hit him ?
For what purpose , love ?	For what order , love ?
But to be frank , and give it thee again .	But I'll be able to give it , and I'll do you again .
And yet I wish but for the thing I have .	And yet I wish for the only I have to do .
My bounty is as boundless as the sea , My love as deep .	My heart's hope is as the discussion as you , my love as much .
I hear some noise within .	I hear some noise over .
Dear love , adieu. , Anon , good Nurse ! , Sweet Montague , be true .	Dear love , please , oh , good Ursula ! , Come , Charmian .
Stay but a little .	Stay like a little .
I will come again .	I will come again .
O blessed , blessed night !	Oh , blessed , oh !
I am afeard , Being in night , all this is but a dream , Too flattering sweet to be substantial .	I am sorry , there's more in this world , but all a dream , it's making me friendly to be married .
Three words , dear Romeo , and good night indeed .	Three words , dear illness and is good here .
Fear me not .	Just tell me .
Let us take the law of our sides .	Don't take us the end of our men .
Let them begin .	Don't bother against me .
I will frown as I pass by , and let them take it as they list .	I will frown as I pass by , and let them take it as they were when they're brave .
Nay , as they dare .	Yes , as they can .
I will bite my thumb at them , which is a disgrace to them , if they bear it .	I will rip my bottle at them , which is a careful luck to them , if they don't bear it .
Do you bite your thumb at us , sir ?	Do you abandon your operation at your places , sir ?
I do bite my thumb , sir .	I want my teeth , sir .
Do you bite your thumb at us , sir ?	Do you abandon your operation at your places , sir ?
Do you quarrel , sir ?	Do you look , sir ?
Quarrel , sir ?	Hello , sir ?
No , sir .	No , sir .
Tomorrow will I send .	Tomorrow will I send .
So thrive my soul , A thousand times good night !	So that's my soul , a thousand times good night !
A thousand times the worse to want thy light .	A thousand times the worse to do damage .
Bondage is hoarse , and may not speak aloud , Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies , And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine , With repetition of "My Romeo ! " It is my soul that calls upon my name .	Believe is ahead , and don't speak up , please , I'll make you out the letter where I gave you , and her tongue more beautiful than she , or that's not ! " she is my name on that name .
How silver-sweet sound lovers ' tongues by night , Like softest music to attending ears !	How does lovers sound after the winds , poisonous John , to watch her own sins !
Romeo !	Yoo-hoo !
My nyas ?	My name's ?
What o'clock tomorrow Shall I send to thee ?	What o'clock will I agree to make you ?
By the hour of nine .	By the hour of every house .
I will not fail .	I will not fail .
Tis twenty year till then .	It's twenty year when then .
I have forgot why I did call thee back .	I have forgotten why I did call you back .
Let me stand here till thou remember it .	Let me stand here until you're talking about .
And I'll still stay , to have thee still forget , Forgetting any other home but this .	And I'll still stay , to have you still alive , don't cut any other but here .
Tis almost morning .	It's almost morning .
And yet no further than a wanton's bird , That lets it hop a little from his hand Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves , And with a silken thread plucks it back again , So loving-jealous of his liberty .	And yet no further than a golden bird , who knows it a little from his hand , a fine boy in his empty veins , with a tiny thread in its crying , before me like his jacket .
I would I were thy bird .	I would I were your bird .
Sweet , so would I .	Sweet , so would I .
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing .	Maybe I could beg you against me .
Good night , good night !	Good night , good night !
Parting is such sweet sorrow That I shall say good night till it be morrow .	They're of such nice sorrow who could see you wait like this time , you'll be married .
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes , peace in thy breast .	They're talking about God's eyes , peace , in your sides .
Would I were sleep and peace , so sweet to rest .	Would I were safe and peace , so sweet to rest .
Hence will I to my ghostly friar's close cell , His help to crave and my dear hap to tell .	Wait will I to my Honor's house up home , he'll beg and to my dear luck to take him .
The gray-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night , Checkering the eastern clouds with streaks of light , And fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels .	The eldest clothes lives on the white mud , bareheaded , the storm with lowly beads of pearly light , and creeping like a parrot around a corpse into blowing and choke his conquering blood .
Now , ere the sun advance his burning eye , The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry , I must upfill this osier cage of ours With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers .	Now , when the sun falls his empty , the day to surrender and on night to catch , I must scratch this meager edge of ours and punish them and smear it punishing me .
The earth , that's nature's mother , is her tomb .	The earth , that's my mother , is her servant .
And from her womb children of divers kind We sucking on her natural bosom find , Many for many virtues excellent , None but for some and yet all different .	And from her children of children are kind of her eyes , I'm very big shrew in her most little , but I've heard all for one , but that's some and all one .
Oh , mickle is the powerful grace that lies In herbs , plants , stones , and their true qualities .	Oh , is the powerful Richmond that lies in heaven , sailors , and frightened , and their bad qualities .
For naught so vile that on the earth doth live But to the earth some special good doth give .	For you're young that on the earth as she can live the earth to have some good mischief to tell us .
Virtue itself turns vice , being misapplied , And vice sometime by action dignified .	Kings itself goes even , being approaching , and Regan's with an action already .
Within the infant rind of this small flower Poison hath residence and medicine power .	Within the goblets of Rome that isn't a dangerous character and smudge him .
Two such opposed kings encamp them still , In man as well as herbs , grace and rude will .	Two such ordinary men there are still , as well as man , they will imagine and grace as many of us .
And where the worser is predominant , Full soon the canker death eats up that plant .	And where the Danish is , too luck , and there is the sword that feeds up .
Good morrow , Father .	Good morning , General .
Benedicite .	Agreed .
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me ?	What criminal loves death so sweet you ?
Young son , it argues a distempered head So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed .	Young son , it wasn't a beggar so down to bring good to your friend until this morning .
Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye , And where care lodges , sleep will never lie .	They're carried away in his bedroom window , but what man's feelings , don't sleep when he will stay .
But where unbruised youth with unstuffed brain Doth couch his limbs , there golden sleep doth reign .	But where maybe honor with brain is even powerful wounds , his lustful death do publicly the price .
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure Thou art uproused by some distemperature .	Therefore your Highness will scare me what you're talking by some real bed .
Or if not so , then here I hit it right : Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight .	Or if not so , then here I hit it : it's not your own qualities and has been able to sleep away in the city .
That last is true .	That last is true .
The sweeter rest was mine .	The proud governor will kill this .
With Rosaline , my ghostly Father ?	With killing , my mistress ?
That's my good son .	That's my good advice .
But where hast thou been , then ?	But where aren't it been , then ?
I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again .	I'll tell you if you've done it again .
Both our remedies Within thy help and holy physic lies .	Both our strongest plan to wear your tongues and rain other .
I bear no hatred , blessed man , for , lo , My intercession likewise steads my foe .	I don't take any , yes , for you , oh , my teacher , my hopes .
