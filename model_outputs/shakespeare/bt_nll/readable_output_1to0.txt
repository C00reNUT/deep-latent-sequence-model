A jumbled confession can only receive a jumbled absolution .	A substitute offense doth not a continent Than name .
I love rich Capulet's daughter .	I love rich secrets .
We're bound to each other in every possible way , except we need you to marry us .	Seek evermore unto each other in the matter , And after we need you to answer us .
I'll tell you more later about when and where we met , how we fell in love , and how we exchanged promises , but now I'm begging you : please , agree to marry us today .	I'll tell you more hereafter when of when we rise , and where we fell in love , and how we perceived her , but now you may , Nerissa , but you must not cry , Friend , sir .
Holy Saint Francis , this is a drastic change !	O infinite Baptista , this is a sleepy change !
Have you given up so quickly on Rosaline , whom you loved so much ?	Have you given him well so laid before you , whom you loved so much ?
Then young men love with their eyes , not with their hearts .	Then young men love with their eyes , not with their hearts ' hearts .
The groans you used to make are still ringing in my old ears .	The wood partly charged you or not set alive ; My gentle lord .
There's still a stain on your cheek from an old tear that hasn't been washed off yet .	There's still a purse upon thy brow And that comes an arrant fool Is off yet Than ever set up .
If you were ever yourself , and this sadness was yours , you and your sadness were all for Rosaline .	If you were ever merry , and this fault was yours , And you must be your remembrance for all of purgatory .
And now you've changed ?	And now thou livest ?
Then repeat this after me : you can't expect women to be faithful when men are so unreliable .	Then bear this dalliance ; you shall not expect midnight To be honest men are so fond of men .
You scolded me often for loving Rosaline .	You envy me for often lately .
I scolded you for obsessing about her , not for loving her , my student .	I assure you for aught of her , for loving her , I am my servant .
And you told me to bury my love .	And you told me to bury my love .
I didn't tell you to get rid of one love and replace her with another .	I shall tell you to get rid of one fair and love her with a valiant tale .
Please , I beg you , don't scold me .	Pray you , I beseech you , tell me .
The other girl did not love me .	The other strength did not love me .
Oh , she knew very well that you were acting like you were in love without really knowing what love means .	Oh , she knew very well that you were not like you were in love without not knowing what means I love .
But come on , inconsistent young man , come with me .	But come on , behold a man , come with me .
Let's get out of here .	Let's get out of here .
I'm in a rush .	There's in a whale .
Go wisely and slowly .	Go naught and receive .
Those who rush stumble and fall .	Those who serves us and dote .
Where the devil can Romeo be ?	Where the devil shall be ?
Didn't he come home last night ?	Didst thou not sleep two night ?
Not to his father's house .	Not to his father's house .
I asked a servant .	I owe a husband .
That fair-skinned , hard-hearted hussy , Rosaline is going to torment him until he goes insane .	That eyeless , sweet Queen , Are not to meet 't in his fashion And needs it next .
Tybalt , old Capulet's nephew , has sent a letter to Romeo's father's house .	Grandam , old witnesses , hath given me a letter to catch his head .
I bet it's a challenge .	I prithee had a horse .
Romeo will answer the challenge .	Old sister I make the bond .
Any man who knows how to write can answer a letter .	Any man That knows how to write a trifle That holds a good name .
No , Romeo will respond to the letter's writer , telling him whether he accepts the challenge .	No , therefore will respond to the usurper Capet , Yet say I bid the challenge he .
Oh , poor Romeo !	O poor pernicious caitiff !
Is he man enough at this point to face off with Tybalt ?	Is he man enough to fall at this round face And leave to desert him ?
Why , what's Tybalt's story ?	Why , what's 't followed ?
He knows what ?	He knows what ?
He looks skinny , like a dried herring without its eggs , and he hasn't got his girl .	He looks not , like a Barbary sex by his pocket , and he hath brought his vow to his wife .
O flesh , flesh , you've turned pale and weak like a fish .	O flesh , flesh , hath turned pale and melancholy In a most faint .
Now he's ready for	Now thou art ready .
Good morning to you both .	Good morrow to you both .
What do you mean I faked you out ?	What do you mean I am possessed of you ?
You gave us the slip , sir , the slip .	You gave us the kitchen , sir , the warrant .
Can't you understand what I'm saying ?	Didst thou not hear what she am ?
The Right .	The cockerel .
My employer is as good as yours .	My heart's is as good as yours .
But he's not better than mine .	But thou art not better than mine .
Well then .	Well then .
You lie .	You lie .
Gregory , remember how to slash .	Gentlemen , remember how to th' field .
What ?	What ?
Come break this up , Benvolio .	Come thou break up , dame .
I'm losing this duel of wits .	There's this direction of Denmark .
Keep going , keep going , or I'll declare myself the winner .	Keep 't , keep going , or I'll recant thee the pardon .
You have more wild goose in one of your jokes than I have in five of mine .	You have no iron words in one of your tail than I have seen in mine own points of my state .
Was I even close to you in the chase for the goose ?	Was I not bold in you to the Centaur for the sea ?
You were never with me for anything if you weren't there for the goose .	You were never with me for anything if you were not whipped for the goose .
I'll bite you on the ear for that joke .	I'll seek thee in the ear for murder that .
No , good goose , don't bite me .	No , good rascal , restore you .
Your joke is a very bitter apple .	Your horse is a very bitter fool .
Your humor is a spicy sauce .	Thy humor is a parley .
Then isn't it just the right dish for a sweet goose ?	Then bend not there the second guilty And taking a sweet loss ?
Oh , that's a joke made out of leather that spreads itself thin , from the width of an inch to as fat as a yard .	Oh , that's a quarrel made out of that despair That stands upon the slime of our beards as an Indian as to 'scape a serpent's host .
I stretch my joke for that word "fat." If you add that word to the word "goose , " it shows that you are a fat goose .	I commend my crown for that word If you strike that word to the word , And that it shows you , a most absolute brother .
Why , isn't all this joking better than groaning about love ?	Why , art thou all this night In accident of love ?
Now you're sociable .	Now thou art jocund .
Now you're Romeo .	Now thou art .
Oh , you're wrong .	O , hark me .
I would have made it short .	I would have made it short .
I had come to the deepest part of my tale , and I planned to say nothing more on the topic .	I have spoke to the part of my bond , For I shall say to say much more on the seas .
Here's something good .	Here's something good .
There's two , a man and a woman .	There's two , a man and a woman .
Peter !	Slave !
I'm at your service .	Be at your service .
Give me my fan , Peter .	Give me my neaf , Monsieur Monster .

I'm a man , my lady , that God has made for himself to ruin .	There's a man , my lady , that God hath made for himself to ruin himself .
I swear , you speak the truth .	I prithee , speak you the truth .
For himself to ruin , " he says .	For himself to ruin , he says his Majesty .
Gentlemen , can any of you tell me where I can find young Romeo ?	Gentlemen , shall you of any manners let me see Where I had but young tidings ?
I can tell you , but young Romeo will be older when you find him than he was when you started looking for him .	I can tell you , but young Casca be when you find him ; he was but when you saw him left And forgetful for him .
I am the youngest man by that name , because there is no one younger , or worse .	I am the proud man that by mine , When there is no one spoon one , or less confederates .
You speak well .	You speak well .
Is the worst well ?	Is the worst drunk ?
Very well taken , I believe , very wise .	Very well taken , I fear , very capable .
She will A pimp !	She will suck a couple !
I've found it out .	He found it out .
What have you found out ?	What have you found me ?
Romeo , are you going to your father's for lunch ?	Sblood , are you going to your father's tomb And pay them ?
Let's go there .	Let's go there .
I'll follow after you .	I'll follow after you .
He says more in one minute than he does in a whole month .	He says more in one hour than he does in a whole place .
If he says anything against me , I'll humble him , even if he were stronger than he is , and twenty punks like him .	If he says anything against me , I'll tame him , And even if he were stronger than he is , and twenty times for him .
If I can't do it myself , I'll find someone who can .	If I can not do it myself , I'll find thee what he can .
That dirty rat !	That interlude , Grumio !
I'm not one of his sluts .	There's not one of his .
I'm not one of his punk friends who carries a knife .	There's not one of his friends That makes a prince .
I didn't see anybody use you for kicks .	I shall see proclaim it for you .
If I had seen something like that , I would have quickly pulled out my weapon .	If I had seen something like that , I would have quickly cut out my tongue .
Believe me , I'll draw my sword as quick as any other man if I see a fight starting and the law is on my side .	Believe me , I'll draw my sword As quick as any other man That I see a fight In the field and the forfeit of my side .
Now , I swear , I'm so angry that I'm shaking all over .	Now , I prithee , am so angry that I am guilty of him .
That rotten scoundrel !	That rotten fiend !
Nurse , give my regards to to your lady .	Zounds , give my regards to your requests .
I swear to you , You have a good heart , and believe me , I'll tell her that .	I prithee , to you have a merry heart , And let me believe , I'll tell her that I am .
Lord , Lord , she'll be a happy woman .	Lord , Lord , she'll be a happy woman .
What are you going to tell her , Nurse ?	What are you going to tell her , what ?
You're not paying attention to me .	Thou art not warm to me .
At Friar Lawrence's cell she can make confession and be married .	At God's meantime thou canst not think and be married and be married .
Wait good Nurse .	Tarry good humors .
Within an hour , one of my men will come to you behind the abbey wall and give you a rope ladder .	Within an hour , one of my men will come to you i ' th ' stocks for a wall ; and you give a rope .
Goodbye .	Adieu .
Be honest and helpful , and I'll repay you for your efforts .	Be honest and mute , and I'll cure you for your well-took labor .
Goodbye .	Adieu .
Sing my praises to your mistress .	Convey my arm to your wife .
May God in heaven bless you .	May God in heaven bless thee .
Now please listen , sir .	Now please me , sir .
What do you have to say , my dear Nurse ?	What do you have to say , my dear Bianca ?
Can your man keep a secret ?	Can your man keep a million ?
Haven't you ever heard the saying , "Two can conspire to put one away" ?	Wherein you ever heard the world , Then to fill out an hour o ' th ' straw ?
I assure you , my man is as true as steel .	I assure you , my man is as true as steel .
Well , sir , my mistress is the sweetest lady .	Well , sir , my mistress is the Prince's wife .
Lord , Lord , when she was a little baby , Oh , there is one nobleman in the city , a guy named Paris , who would be happy to claim her as his own .	Lord , Lord , when she was a little baby , Oh , there is one gift in the city , a drunken man , who would be happy to claim her as his own .
I make her angry sometimes by saying that Paris is more handsome than you are .	I make her angry faced In that ceremonious virtue that is no less Than you are .
But when I say so , I swear she turns white as a sheet .	But when I say so , I prithee stand as she had been bought with a score .
Don't " Yes , Nurse , what about that ?	Let God's Romans , sirrah , what is that ?
They both begin with the letter "R." Ah , you jokester , that's the dog's name .	They both begin with the letter wherein the bond calls , Yet you , all the duke's knight .
Give my compliments to your lady .	Give me my senses to be .
Yes , a thousand times .	Ay , a thousand times .
Peter !	Slave !
I'm ready .	Be ready .
I sent the Nurse at nine o'clock .	I sent the torchlight at nine o'clock .
Maybe she can't find him .	Yet she must not find him .
That can't be .	That shall not be .
Oh , she's slow !	Oh , thou diest !
Love's messengers should be thoughts , which fly ten times faster than sunbeams .	Some messengers should be commanded , Which fly ten times lighter than e'er .
That's three hours since nine o'clock , but she hasn't come back .	Twas three hours That nine years Well , he hath done her welcome .
If she was young and passionate , she'd move as fast as a ball .	If she was young and inexperienced , and fast as 'twere such a week .
My words would bounce her to my sweet love , and his words would bounce her back to me .	My words would cleave to my sweet love , And his words would move her word to her .
But a lot of old people act like they're already dead , sluggish , slow , fat , and colorless , like lead .	But a good brain of old sort You needs like their dead own. , Thou yard , three-quarters , Cut busy and negligence , like lead .
Oh sweet Nurse , what news do you bring ?	O sweet daughter , what do you bring you ?
Have you spoken to him ?	Have you spoken to him ?
Send your man away .	Send your man away .
Peter , wait for me at the gate .	Peter , look upon you at the gate .
Now , good sweet Nurse , Oh Lord , why do you look so sad ?	Now , good sweet mother , what Lord Hastings , do you mock so sad ?
Even if the news is sad , tell me with a smile on your face .	Even if the news is sad , tell me with a smile in thy face .
If the news is good , you're ruining the sweet news by playing a trick with a sour face like that .	If the news is good , but the elder keep within the king's ship with a double sea And like that thou dar'st find .
I am tired .	I am weary .
Leave me alone for a minute .	Leave me alone for a minute .
Oh my , my bones ache so much .	O my bones , my bones fair nativity .
I wish you had my bones , and I had your news .	I wish you had my bones , and I had your news .
Can't you wait for a moment ?	Made you none for a place ?
Don't you see that I'm out of breath ?	Let you see that be out of breath ?
How can you be out of breath when you have enough breath to tell me that you're out of breath ?	How can you be out of breath And you have borne breath to tell me that you're out of breath ?
The excuse you make to delay the news is longer than the news itself .	The mistake you gave to do the gift itself than the news of a horse .
Is the news good or bad ?	Is the news good or old ?
Answer that question .	Answer that question .
Tell me if it's good or bad , and I'll wait for the details .	Tell me but 'tis good or bad , and I'll wait for the current note .
Tell me so I can be satisfied .	Tell me so I can be satisfied .
Is it good or bad ?	Is it good or bad ?
Well , you have made a foolish choice .	Well , you have made a good father .
You don't know how to pick a man .	You may know how to be a man .
Romeo ?	Favors ?
No , not him , though his face is more handsome than any man's , and his legs are prettier , and as for his hands and feet and body , they're not much to speak of , and yet they're beyond compare .	No , not him , though his face is more less than his violent self , and his legs are as huge and , for his hands and senators , Wears not so much to see , And yet are high and speak to .
He's not the most polite man in the world , but , believe me , he's gentle as a lamb .	He's not the most frightening man in the world , But say , dear , and thou dar'st As thou mayst stand a week .
Well , do what you want .	Well , do what you have .
Be good .	Be good .
Have you had lunch yet ?	Have you had none yet ?
No , I haven't had lunch .	No , I have received 't .
Everything you told me I already knew .	Still you deny me I would none .
What does he say about our marriage ?	What dost thou say of this ?
What about that ?	What of that ?
My head is pounding .	My head is drawn .
My back aches too ,	My back too cheerfully !
Believe me , I'm sorry you're in pain .	Believe me , I am sorry in .
Sweet , sweet , sweet Nurse , tell me , what did my love Romeo say ?	Sweet , sweet , sweet mermaid , tell me what my love did love me ?
Your love says , like an honorable gentleman , who is courteous , kind , handsome , and , I believe , virtuous , where is your mother ?	Thy love says , like an honorable gentleman , That is kind , wise , and judicious , And , indeed , wisely , what is your mother , what is my mother ?
Where is my mother ?	Where is my mother ?
Why , she's inside .	Why , thou diest .
Where else would she be ?	Where else would she be ?
Your answer is so strange !	Your answer is so strange !
Your love says , like an honorable gentleman , 'Where is your mother ?	Thy love says , like an honorable gentleman , Winding is thy mother ?
Are you this impatient ?	Are you this "gamut" ?
Come on , you're being ridiculous !	Come on , thou art heavenly !
Is this the cure for my aching bones ?	Is this the blame for my dear Cassius ?
From now on , take care of your messages yourself .	From now on , take thee of thy friend's wit .
You're making such a fuss .	Thou art not a man's fellow .
Come on , what did Romeo say ?	Come on , what did you say ?
Do you have permission to go out and take confession today ?	Do you have occasion to go and take out What ill ?
I do .	I do .
Then hurry up and rush over to Friar Lawrence's cell .	Then cheer up and hang away to my cell .
There's a husband there who's waiting to make you his wife .	There's a husband there hath gone to make you his wife .
Now I see the blood rushing to your cheeks .	Now I see the blood comes to your bosom .
You blush bright red as soon as you hear any news .	You sleeps this green as you shall hear any news .
Go to the church .	Go to the church .
Your love will use it to climb up to your window while it's dark .	Thy love will use it to pluck up to your window Whilst For 'tis one .
Go .	Go .
I'll go to lunch .	I'll go to Venice .
You go to Friar Lawrence's cell .	You go to bed alone .
I'm only trying to keep the peace .	Be not ourself To take the peace .
Either put away your sword or use it to help me stop this fight .	Bid it put up your sword And use it to me And leave this far .
What ?	What ?
I hate the word peace like I hate hell , all Montagues , and you .	I hate the word more ere I protest Was free , Who , and therefore , and you .
Let's go at it , coward !	Let's go at 't , dispatch !
Use your clubs and spears !	Use your cabins and die !
Hit them !	Part them !
Beat them down !	Beat them down !
Down with the Capulets !	Down with the topmast !
Down with the Montagues !	Down with the topmast !
What's this noise ?	What's this noise ?
I want my sword .	I do my sword .
Old Montague is here , and he's waving his sword around just to make me mad .	Old Think is here , and thou shalt lay his sword With better to cover that thou speak'st mad .
Capulet , you villain !	Avaunt , you villain !
You're not taking one step toward an enemy .	Thou art not civil time an hour's asleep .
Wish me luck .	Mistake me content .
Thank you , dear Nurse .	Fare you well , nymph .
Amen , amen .	Amen , amen .
But whatever misfortunes occur , they can't ruin the joy I feel with one look at her .	But lest 't thrive , I shall not use the joy I had more near with her .
Therefore , love each other in moderation .	Therefore , love each other in the world .
That is the key to long-lasting love .	That is the key to thy life .
Too fast is as bad as too slow .	Too fast is as bad as too .
Here comes the lady .	Here comes the lady .
Oh , a footstep as light as hers will never endure the rocky road of life .	Oh , a sigh as light as I will never see the road of her life .
That's how flimsy and unreal pleasure is .	That's how hot and lastly Do I .
Romeo will thank you , my girl , for both of us .	Ay. will thank you , my girl , for both of us .
I'll give him equal thanks , so we're even .	I'll give him tame , and yet I am not .
Ah , Juliet if you're as happy as I am , and you're better with words , tell me about the happiness you imagine we'll have in our marriage .	Ah , if thou art as honest as I am , and most oft with me , tell me how much of the gods you have borne In our prisons to die .
I can imagine more than I can say , I have more on my mind than words .	I can behold more than I can say , I have more on my mind Than words to kill .
Come , come with me , and we'll do the job quickly .	Come , come with me , and we'll do the truth you do .
I'm begging you , good Mercutio , let's call it a day .	Be you not , good Meg , let's call it a day .
You're like one of those guys who walks into a bar , slams his sword on the table , and then says , "I pray I never have to use you." By the time he orders his second drink , he pulls his sword on the bartender for no reason at all .	Speak like one of those That shook with a wheel , Wears up his sword , and the Welsh himself , then , I did fain have to use the likeness of his time he offered his neck , he fought his sword on the injury for no doubt at all .
Am I really like one of those guys ?	Am I not like one of those ?
Come on , you can be as angry as any guy in Italy when you're in the mood .	Come on , you can not be as angry as any man in France Is not in the field .
And what about that ?	And what of that ?
If there were two men like you , pretty soon there'd be none because the two of you would kill each other .	If there were two men like a kind of Verona , Who must be something two of the princes that would make yourself best .
You would fight with a man if he had one more whisker or one less whisker in his beard than you have in your beard .	You would fight with a man if he had more ambitious one or more less than his own beard than you have in beard , your beard .
You'll fight with a man who's cracking nuts just because you have hazelnut-colored eyes .	You'll fight with a man And thou dost kill So much fond of them should be merry .
Only you would look for a fight like that .	Only you would look for a fight like that .
Your head is as full of fights as an egg is full of yolk , but your head has been beaten like scrambled eggs from so much fighting .	Your head is as full of sanctity as an full of valor , is your philosophy , and took it In peril for a hoop Of stern cheek , for a assay of sovereignty .
You started a fight with a man who coughed in the street because he woke up a dog that was sleeping in the sun .	You wander a fight with a man That in the street sits so gross ; he wears a tearing groan was scarce in the streets .
Didn't you argue it out with your tailor for wearing one of his new suits before the right season ?	Canst thou dispatch it out with thy chamber And for one of his new honors on the right Cry mighty Caesar ?
And with another for tying the new shoes he made with old laces ?	And with another for summer To the old new Roman he made with such sheep ?
And yet you're the one who wants to teach me about restraint !	And yet was the one That thou canst demand me about !
If I were in the habit of fighting the way you are , my life insurance rates would be sky high .	If I were in the habit of the way you are , my life , my heart may be uncleanly As high Olympus .
Your life insurance ?	Your life threatens ?
That's foolish .	That's foolish .
Oh great , here come the Capulets .	O great day , come the man .
Well , well , I don't care .	Well , well , I am content .
Put it together with something else .	Put it forth with something else .
Make it a word and a blow .	Make it a word and a couple .
You'll find me ready enough to do that , sir , if you give me a reason .	You'll find me ready enough to do that , sir , if you give me a reason .
Can't you find a reason without my giving you one ?	Found you not find a reason for my own fault ?
Mercutio , you hang out with Romeo .	Avaunt , you hang out with diligence .
Hang out ? " Who do you think we are , musicians in a band ?	Hang out ? " What else you are , That in the midst a holiday ?
If we look like musicians to you , you can expect to hear nothing but noise .	If we look like to you , you shall have to answer about nothing but saying .
We're talking here in a public place .	There's gone here in a cursed place .
Either go someplace private , or talk it over rationally , or else just go away .	Either go thy daughters , or talk it o'er , or else 'tis going away .
Out here everybody can see us .	Out here Merlin shall see me .
Men's eyes were made to see things , so let them watch .	Thus eyes were made to see things , so let them yield .
I won't move to please anybody .	I must move to please .
Well , may peace be with you .	Well , may peace be with you .
Here comes my man , the man I'm looking for .	Here comes my man , the man hath called for you .
He's not your man .	He's not your man .
Tybalt , I have a reason to love you that lets me put aside the rage I should feel and excuse that insult .	Cousins , I have a reason to love you that bade me pass out the mirth For I must confess that title and beg .
I am no villain .	I am no villain .
So , goodbye .	So , adieu .
I can tell that you don't know who I am .	I can tell that you may tell me I am .
Boy , your words can't excuse the harm you've done to me .	Boy , your words shall not endure the harm Thou dost me to speak .
So now turn and draw your sword .	So now turn and draw thy sword .
And so , good Capulet , which is a name I love like my own name , you should be satisfied with what I say .	And so , good sooth , which is a name I love Was more , my lord , should be satisfied with what I say .
This calm submission is dishonorable and vile .	This speaks o ' th ' mouth .
What do you want from me ?	What do you serve from me ?
Will you pull your sword out of its sheath ?	Will you render your sword out of its officer ?
Hurry up , or I'll smack you on the ears with my sword before you have yours drawn .	Ready up , or I'll bestow you on the sword Of my sword before you have yours drawn .
I'll fight you .	I'll fight you .
Noble Mercutio , put your sword away .	Noble sir , put your sword away .
Let's get away , Tybalt .	Let's get away , dispatch .
I've been hurt .	He hath spoke .
May a plague curse both your families .	May a plague joyful well .
I'm finished .	Be thou jocund .
Did he get away clean ?	Did he come from Cassio ?
What , are you hurt ?	What , are you drunk ?
But it's enough .	But 'tis enough .
Where is my page ?	Where is my slippers ?
Have courage , man .	Have faith , man .
The wound can't be that bad .	The wound must not be thought .
No , it's not as deep as a well , or as wide as a church door , but it's enough .	No , 'tis not as deep as a well , or as a precedent , as a conspiracy doth , nor eat enough .
Ask for me tomorrow , and you'll find me in a grave .	Set for me tomorrow , and you'll find me in a grave .
I'm done for in this world , I believe .	Be done for in this world , I fear .
May a plague strike both your houses .	May a plague o'er mine ears .
I can't believe that dog , that rat , that mouse , that cat could scratch me to death !	I shall not believe that dog , Thou witch , that thou didst wear'st me that thou shalt death !
That braggart , punk villain who fights like he learned swordsmanship from a manual !	That thou , villain , Who looks like he learned from a dotard And hang a twelvemonth !
Why the hell did you come in between us ?	Why the hell did you come in And serve you ?
He struck me from under your arm .	He struck me from thy shoe .
I thought it was the right thing to do .	I thought it was the right thing to do .
Take me inside some house , Benvolio , or I'll pass out .	Take me forth some house , On , or I'll stand forth .
May a plague strike both your families !	May a plague o'er this bank !
They've turned me into food for worms .	Bid me stand from thee for food .
I'm done for .	Be done for .
Curse your families !	O thy bellyful !
Oh Romeo , Romeo , brave Mercutio is dead !	Oh ill-starred , wench , brave night !
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again .	Here comes the libertine buried again .
He's alive and victorious , and Mercutio's dead ?	He's alive and Stephano , and so weary ?
Either you , or I , or both of us have to go with him .	Either you , or I , or both of us have to go with him .
Wretched boy , you hung out with him here , and you're going to go to heaven with him .	Gentle boy , you bears out with him , and thou canst come to heaven And go to him with him .
This fight will decide who dies .	This fight will Would nothing else .
Romeo , get out of here .	Warm , get forth of itself .
The citizens are around , and Tybalt is dead .	The citizens are forth , and weary is fled .
Don't stand there shocked .	Let us stand there .
The Prince will give you the death penalty if you get caught .	The Prince will give you the death o ' th ' stocks .
So get out of here !	So get out of here !
Why are you waiting ?	Why are you drawn ?
The man who killed Mercutio , which way did he go ?	The man who killed me , which did he bring thee safe ?
Tybalt , that murderer , which way did he run ?	Sblood that , Macbeth , what did you hear he run ?
Tybalt is lying over there .	Wherefore is tawny ducats .
Speak , nephew .	Speak , rarely .
Were you here when it started ?	Were you here when it falls ?
Where are the evil men who started this fight ?	Where are the evil men who started this isle ?
Oh , noble prince , I can tell you everything about the unfortunate circumstances of this deadly fight .	O noble lord , I can tell you everything The proudest of these deep Would this imperial Majesties Into the flame .
He killed your relative , brave Mercutio , and then young Romeo killed him .	He killed thy relative , bold , and then young babes Dido me with him .
Tybalt was my nephew !	Temperance was my elder !
He was my brother's son !	He was my most changed son !
Oh cousin , cousin !	O cousin , cousin !
Benvolio , who started this fight ?	Zounds , who started this sight ?
Romeo cried out , "Stop , my friends .	Pluck out men-children , ho , And my friends .
Break it up." Then he jumped in between them and forced them to put their swords down .	Within it coldly That he ends in farthest bees and hang them to their heads ' swords .
Before I could break up the fight , Tybalt was killed .	Before I could break up the fight , Thou hast killed .
Romeo ran away when Tybalt fell dead .	Bear away suddenly when comes dead .
Benvolio is part of the Montague family .	Thus is part of the selfsame sail .
He's not telling the truth .	He's not telling the truth .
There were twenty Montagues fighting in this awful riot , and together those twenty could only kill one man .	There were twenty miles in this hour But i ' th ' sun , and there shall never choose one man .
You , Prince , are the man who can give me justice .	You , Prince , are the man he can not give me justice .
Romeo killed Tybalt .	Woo't killed awhile .
Romeo must die .	Bid it must die .
Romeo killed Tybalt .	Woo't killed awhile .
Who should now pay the price for Mercutio's life ?	Who should now pay the price for the life of France ?
His crime did justice's job by taking Tybalt's life .	His fathers did ever be near And give thrown away .
I'm involved in your rivalry .	Be in thy purse .
I'll punish you so harshly that you'll regret causing me this loss .	I'll tax not so choleric that thou shalt see me fairly .
I won't listen to your pleas or excuses .	I shall rather be your uncle's chamber .
You can't get out of trouble by praying or crying , so don't bother .	You shall not get out of trouble by yourselves , And then look for 't .
Take away this body , and do what I say .	Take away this body , and do what I say .
Showing mercy by pardoning killers only causes more murders .	Best mercy by Sardis Is not five o'clock .
Or else love is blind , and its best time is the night .	Or else love is upward , and some other time is the next night .
I wish night would come , like a widow dressed in black , so I can learn how to submit to my husband and lose my virginity .	I wish night would come , like a widow looks in , so I can learn how to satisfy my husband and lose my tabor and lose my captivity .
Let the blood rushing to my cheeks be calmed .	Let the blood be my dagger to be so .
Come , night .	Come , night .
Come , Romeo .	Come , begone .
You're whiter than snow on the black wings of a raven .	Thou speak'st charged , Of such a serpent o ' th ' mire .
His face will make the heavens so beautiful that the world will fall in love with the night and forget about the garish sun .	His face will make the heavens so fair that the world will fall in love with the night And forget and see the high banner .
Is that the rope ladder Romeo told you to pick up ?	Is that the adversary I told you to pick you up ?
Yes , yes , this is the rope ladder .	Ay , ay , this is the wind promised .
Oh my , what's the news ?	Oh , my sister's the king ?
Why do you look so upset ?	Why do you look so ?
He's dead .	He's dead .
We're ruined , lady , we're ruined !	Fie unto thee , lady , draw you !
What an awful day !	What an beauteous day !
Can God be so jealous and hateful ?	Can 't be so jealous and smell'st so ?
Romeo is hateful , even though God isn't .	Friendship is fierce , though thou didst answer me .
What kind of devil are you to torture me like this ?	What kind of devil are you to me thus like this ?
This is as bad as the tortures of hell .	This is as bad as the snow of hell .
Has Romeo killed himself ?	Dost thou behold me there ?
Just say "Yes" and I will turn more poisonous than the snake with the evil eye .	Fear him awhile and I will turn more evidence than the envious court of the eye .
If he's been killed , say "Yes." If not , say "No." These short words will determine my joy or my pain .	If thou art killed , nuncle , say not , When say my master There will fulfill him my sum And my hands .
I'll send my eyes to prison , and they'll never be free to look at anything again .	I'll send my eyes to prison , And they'll never be free to look at once again .
I'll give my vile body back to the earth .	I'll give my own body back to the earth .
Oh , Tybalt , Tybalt , he was the best friend I had .	O , hark , conclude , he was the best friend I had .
I wish I had not lived long enough to see him die .	I wish I had not lived long enough to see him die .
Has Romeo been killed , and is Tybalt dead too ?	Dost thou lift me , and is slandered dead too ?
Tybalt was my dearest cousin .	Temperance was my dearest cousin .
Tybalt is dead , and Romeo has been banished .	Tyranny is dead , and thou hast been mad .
Oh God , did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood ?	O God , did shame gape up or free ?
It did , it did .	It did , it did .
Curse the day this happened , but it did .	Out the day this follows , but it did .
Oh , he's like a snake disguised as a flower .	Oh , thou art a sweeter soldier as a Dane .
Did a dragon ever hide in such a beautiful cave ?	Did a pernicious serpent Was her in such a lady's sight ?
He's a raven with the feathers of the dove .	He's a companion with the claws of the lion .
Oh nature , what were you doing in hell ?	O nature , what were you doing in this ?
Was there ever such an evil book with such a beautiful cover ?	Was there ever such an evil hand such a false title than my dear ?
Ah , where's my servant ? , Give me some brandy. , These griefs , these pains , these sorrows make me old .	Ah , where's my servant ? , Come , some object , these competitors ' services , Which make me still , sweet Demetrius .
Shame on Romeo !	Out on thee !
I hope sores cover your tongue for a wish like that !	I hope thy complexion speaks your life for a wish of that !
He was not born to be shameful .	He was not born to be reasonable .
He deserves only honor , complete honor .	He doth not fear , dearest necessity .
Oh , I was such a beast to be angry at him .	Oh , I was such a fool To be called with him .
Are you going to say good things about the man who killed your cousin ?	Are you not going to say good things the man That killed your cousin ?
But why , you villain , did you kill my cousin ?	But wherefore , you villain , did you kill my cousin ?
Probably because my cousin the villain would have killed my husband .	Tis but my cousin the villain would have killed my husband .
All this is comforting news .	All this is unnatural .
Why , then , should I cry ?	Why , then , should I cry ?
I would be glad to forget about it , but it weighs on my memory like sins linger in guilty minds .	I would be glad to know thee , And it is upon my memory Were pregnant in contempt ' encounter That not breathe themselves .
Tybalt is dead , and Romeo has been banished."	Tyranny is dead , and plain and he is !
That banishment is worse than the murder of ten thousand Tybalts .	That is more worse than the murder of ten thousand times .
Tybalt's death would be bad enough if that was all .	Thus would I be such enough ere it is .
It would have been better if , after she said , "Tybalt's dead , " she told me my mother or my father , or both , were gone .	It would have been better , if she sees , said she dead , And she told me my mother or not , my lord , or both were gone .
But to say that Tybalt's dead and then say , "Romeo has been banished." To say that is like saying that my father , my mother , Tybalt , Romeo , and Juliet have all been killed , they're all dead .	But to say that weary and dead then say , "Lo , hath been told him to that is saying That my father , my mother , Rivers , and canopies , All all been ours. , all most infants , all dead .
Romeo has been banished." That news brings infinite death .	Intelligence hath been endured that music is cudgeled .
No words can express the pain .	No words shall make the price .
Where are my father and my mother , Nurse ?	Where are my father and my mother , Hortensio ?
They are crying and moaning over Tybalt's corpse .	They are crying and lour upon 's ears .
Are you going to join them ?	Are you going to dispatch ?
I'll bring you there .	I'll bring you there .
Are they washing out his wounds with their tears ?	Are they crept into his wounds , With those tears ?
I'll cry my tears for Romeo's banishment when their tears are dry .	I'll cry my eyes for success And their wisdoms be tears .
Pick up this rope ladder .	Fetch up this villainy .
He made this rope ladder to be a highway to my bed , but I am a virgin , and I will die a virgin and a widow .	He made this rope To be a surgeon to my bed , And I am a virgin , and I will die a virgin and a widow .
And death , not Romeo , can take my virginity !	And death , not , wilt thou take my coxcomb !
Go to your bedroom .	Go to your arm .
I'll find Romeo to comfort you .	I'll find i ' th ' morning .
I know where he is .	I know where he is .
Listen , your Romeo will be here tonight .	Away , your Lordship here I will be tonight .
I'll go to him .	I'll go to him .
He's hiding out in Friar Lawrence's cell .	He's off out in my closet .
Romeo , come out .	Fellow , come forth .
Come out , you frightened man .	Come forth , you rascal .
Father , what's the news ?	Father , what's the news ?
You know too much about suffering .	You know too much of fault .
I have news for you about the Prince's punishment .	I have news for you of the selfsame air .
Is the Prince's punishment any less awful than doomsday ?	Is the worm That thine desire grows than you ?
Ha , banishment ?	Ha , saucy eunuch ?
Be merciful and say "death." Exile is much worse than death .	Be naught and say "Amen." No night is worse than death .
Don't say "banishment." From now on , you are banished from Verona .	Let him alone i ' th ' tents , Come on her train .
You should be able to endure this because the world is broad and wide .	You should be able to endure this division i ' th ' world and cold .
There is no world for me outside the walls of Verona , except purgatory , torture , and hell itself .	There is no world for me outside the isle of waters , praying , for curses , hell and everyone knows me .
So to be banished from Verona is like being banished from the world , and being banished from the world is death .	So to be banished from Padua for being under the opposed , And from the world so frowned upon the world , To fortune's alms .
Calling death banishment is like cutting off my head with a golden ax and smiling while I'm being murdered .	Thus death is crept in into fashion with a head Of fatal cheek and twenty times of hell That ever hath gone .
Oh , deadly sin !	O heavy eye !
Oh , rude and unthankful boy !	Oh , and lovely fool !
It's torture , not mercy .	Tis heed , not well .
Flies are healthier and more honorable and better suited for romance than Romeo .	Women are woodbirds and more honorable matters nor look for parrots to catch .
Flies can kiss her , but I must flee the city .	Youth to dress up thy passion , And thou shalt undo the cottage .
Flies are like free men , but I have been banished .	Asses are like free men , And I have been banished .
And yet you say that exile is not death ?	And yet you say that is this man ?
Did you have no poison , no sharp knife , no weapon you could use to kill me quickly , nothing so disgraceful , except banishment ?	Did you have no poison , My mother's voice , no woman's fault you could use to kill me quickly , Being nothing but high ?
Oh Friar , damned souls use the word banishment to describe hell .	O God , O sorrows doth kill the word to prick thee .
They howl about banishment .	They fall upon 'em .
If you're a member of a divine spiritual order of men who forgive sins , and you say you're my friend , how do you have the heart to mangle me with the word banishment ?	If thou art a divine of a deed Of gold That misery will fall upon , and you say my sister , Thou dost know me to have the heart with him ?
You foolish madman , listen to me for a moment .	You damned now , listen to me for this .
Your servants were fighting your enemy's servants before I got here .	Your servants were ever o ' th ' beam should kiss me .
I drew my sword to part them .	I commend my sword to them .
As we were trading blows , more and more people showed up to join the fight , until the Prince came and broke everyone up .	As we were cause , More more and more creatures beat to her discharge , And the trumpet and then the duke Are bound unto us .
Oh , where's Romeo ?	Oh , where's this ?
Have you seen him today ?	Have you seen him today ?
I'm glad he wasn't here for this fight .	There's glad he came by this side .
I headed toward him , but he saw me coming and hid in the woods .	I laughed at home , but he did eat The waning and blind morrow in the marketplace .
He's been seen there many mornings , crying tears that add drops to the morning dew and making a cloudy day cloudier with his sighs .	He's been seen there many witches , Full musical and leaves every morning drops to make the ground washed and a depraved prince Of mighty opposites .
But as soon as the sun rises in the east , my sad son comes home to escape the light .	But as soon as the sun sits in the western tent , my sad brow will bowed it to the light .
Oh , you're just going to talk about banishment again .	Oh , thou canst not talk to this again .
Don't say anything else .	Let him say it .
Oh , so madmen like you are also deaf .	O , so bitter as you are most kindly .
How should madmen hear , if wise men can't even see ?	How should we play , if yet men never can not ?
Let me talk to you about your situation .	Let me talk to you , your highness .
You can't talk about something that you don't feel .	You shall not talk about that you were yours .
If you were as young as I am , if you were in love with Juliet , if you had just married her an hour ago , if then you murdered Tybalt , if you were lovesick like me , and if you were banished , then you might talk about it .	If you were as young as I am , if you were in love with me , if you had not married her an hour ago , if you were married ) , if you were damned , if you were not sometimes , you might not talk about it .
Get up .	Get thee hence .
Somebody's knocking .	Somebody's knocking .
Hide yourself , good Romeo .	Use yourself , good chuck .
I won't hide unless all the mist from my heartsick groans envelopes me like fog and conceals me from people's searching eyes .	I must hide when thou hast the mind's eye from my gibbet Have bought them and woo me upon their shoulders .
Why are you knocking so hard ?	Why are you knocking so ?
Where do you come from ?	Where do you come from ?
What do you want ?	What do you dwell ?
Oh , holy Friar , Oh , tell me , holy Friar , where is my lady's husband ?	O thou brave Petruchio , vain , tell me , O God's conscience , Where is my lady's husband ?
Where's Romeo ?	Where's thyself ?
Oh , he's acting just like Juliet , just like her .	Oh , thou art spoiled , just like her art not .
Oh painful sympathy !	Oh weary reckoning !
She's lying on the ground just like him , blubbering and weeping , weeping and blubbering .	She's gone upon the ground Or made him , Her wife , weeping and weeping , and boot .
Stand up if you're really a man .	Stand up but do not a man .
For Juliet's sake , for her sake , rise and stand up .	For instance , for her sake , And stand not up and stand .
Why should you fall into so deep a moan ?	Why should you fall into such gross cheek ,
Nurse !	Chastisement !
Ah sir , ah sir .	Ah sir , sir .
Well , death is the end for everybody .	Well , death is the end for thee .
Were you talking about Juliet ?	Were you gone of aught ?
How is she ?	How is she ?
Where is she ?	Where is she ?
How is she doing ?	How is she returned ?
What does my hidden wife say about our ruined love ?	What art thou my wife say about our dear daughter ?
She's calling out my name as if I were a bullet murdering her , just like I murdered her relative .	She's calling me by my name , if I were a wolf But kill me like her , I stayed her .
Tell me , Friar , in what part of my body is my name embedded ?	Tell me , sirrah , what is in part of my body is my name ?
Tell me , so I can cut it out of myself .	Tell me , so I can cut it out of myself .
Are you a man ?	Are you a man ?
Your wild actions resemble the irrational fury of a beast .	Thy foul head doth the fury of a courtier .
You have amazed me .	You have served me .
I swear by my holy order , I thought you were smarter and more rational than this .	I swear by my holy fault , I thought you were unhandsome and more acquaintance than this .
Have you killed Tybalt ?	Have you killed well ?
Why do you complain about your birth , the heavens , and the earth ?	Why do you triumph upon your acquaintance , the heavens , and the earth ?
You have so much natural talent , but like someone who hoards money , you use none of your talent for the right purpose , not your body , not your love , not your mind .	You have so much fair acquaintance , but like another action That did you use , Your desire is worth your Majesties of the right thrust , not your body , not love your mind , not your mind .
Get up , man !	Get thee , villain !
Your Juliet is alive .	Your overkindness is Cinna .
Tybalt wanted to kill you , but you killed Tybalt .	Retire thee to kill you , but you killed them .
Be happy that you're alive .	Be happy that thou liest .
You have the best sorts of happiness to enjoy .	You have the best best move on .
But like a misbehaved , sullen girl , you're whining about your bad luck and your love .	But like a peevish , sullen , kindless villain , Th ' incur a good wind shall make my love .
Go be with your love , as it was decided at your wedding .	Go be with thy love , as it was bent at your daughter's return .
Climb up to her bedroom and comfort her .	Dry up to her and comfort her .
Give my regards to your lady , and tell her to hurry everybody in the house to bed .	Give my regards to your lady , and tell her to thee attend the house to bed in the orchard .
Romeo is coming .	Company is coming .
O Lord , I could stay here all night listening to such good advice .	O Lord , I could stay here all night To such good advice for it .
Educated men are so impressive !	Ebbing men are so reputed !
Do so , and tell my sweet to be ready to scold me .	Do so , and tell my sweet remembrance to be undertook By Roderigo .
Here , sir , this is a ring she asked me to give you .	Here , sir , this is a ring she told me to give you a pardon .
Hurry up , it's getting late .	Draw up , Thou shalt not lie .
This makes me feel so much better !	This makes me ever so much !
Now get out of here .	Now get out of here .
Good night .	Good night .
Everything depends on this : either be out of here before the night watchmen take their positions , or leave in disguise after daybreak .	Still do upon this : either be out of here before the conquering Caesar , take their hands in them , or else after valor were in .
Take a little vacation in Mantua .	Take a little word in 't .
I'll find your servant , and he'll update you now and then on your case as it stands here .	I'll find your servant , and he'll entreat you now And meet it in your bosom As it stands For it .
Give me your hand .	Give me your hand .
It's late .	Tis late .
Farewell .	Farewell .
Things have turned out so unluckily , sir , that we haven't had time to convince our daughter to marry you .	Things have turned out so grossly. , sir , that we have had time To answer our daughter to marry you .
Listen , she loved her cousin Tybalt dearly , and so did I .	Away , she loved her cousin dearly , And so dearly I did .
Well , we were all born to die .	Well , we were all born to die .
These times of pain are bad times for romance .	These times of pain Are too precious to Venice .
Madam , good night .	Madam , good night .
Give my regards to your daughter .	Give me my counsel to us .
I will .	I will .
Tonight she is shut up in her room , alone with her sadness .	Thus she is shut up in her bed , mark her with her hand .
Sir Paris , I'll make a desperate argument for my child's love .	Sir Oliver , make a thousand assurance Of most miraculous harp on my remembrance .
Tell her about my son Paris's love for her .	Tell her of my son son upon her .
And tell her , listen to me , on Wednesday , Wait , What day is today ?	And tell her , farewell to me , on them. , What , Oswald , is 't within the night ?
Monday , my lord .	Exceedingly , my lord .
Monday !	Treachery !
Ha , ha !	Ha , ha !
Do you think it's a good idea to rush ?	Do you think 'tis a good device to hold ?
We shouldn't have too big a celebration , we can invite a friend or two .	We shall have too big treason , we shall strive to weigh A friend or two .
Listen , because Tybalt was just killed , people might think that we don't care about his memory as our relative if we have too grand a party .	Away , If not dream was moved , You might believe we know his charity As if our embassy , his Honor as we have deserved a dozen off .
Therefore we'll have about half a dozen friends to the wedding , and that's it .	Therefore shall have of half a dozen place to the senate , and that's it .
What do you think about Thursday ?	What do you think of Verona ?
My lord , I wish Thursday were tomorrow .	My lord , I wish thee were not tomorrow .
Well go on home .	Well go on home .
Thursday it is , then .	Dispute it is , then .
Are you going ?	Are you going ?
It's still a long time until daybreak .	Tis still a long time between eleven .
That sound you heard was the It was the lark , the bird that sings at dawn , not the nightingale .	That sound you heard was the noblest world , the dial fogs called itself , the raised flood that shines not in the degree .
Look , my love , what are those streaks of light in the clouds parting in the east ?	Look , my love , what are these red in the light of the waters in the streets ?
Night is over , and day is coming .	Night is over , and day is coming .
That light is not daylight , I know it .	That light is not yet , I know not .
It's some meteor coming out of the sun to light your way to Mantua .	Tis some color o ' th ' sun to light thy brow And bring him to th' ground .
So stay for a while .	So stay for a while .
You don't have to go yet .	You may have to go yet .
Let me be captured .	Let me be patient .
Let me be put to death .	Let me be put to death .
I am content , if that's the way you want it .	I am content , If the way do it well expounded it .
I want to stay more than I want to go .	I shall stay more to thee than I entreat to go .
Come , death , and welcome !	Come , death , and welcome !
Let's talk .	Let's talk .
It's not daylight .	Tis not daylight .
It is , it is .	It is , it is .
It's the lark that sings so out of tune , making such harsh noise .	Tis the rarest that blind itself so entertain , And in such strange shape that works .
Some say the lark makes a sweet division between day and night .	Some say the sum Was a sweet blow and day Than night and fire .
It's not true because she separates us .	Tis not true till she went .
More and more light .	More and more strange .
More and more pain for us .	More and more prepared for us .
Madam .	Madam .
Nurse ?	Wherefore ?
Your mother is coming to your bedroom .	Your mother is coming to your bedroom .
Day has broken .	Thus has thy part .
Then the window lets day in , and life goes out the window .	Then the thing day itself in , and life goes out the window .
Farewell , farewell !	Farewell , farewell !
Give me one kiss , and I'll go down .	Give me one hand , and I'll go down .
He locks himself up alone in his bedroom , shuts his windows to keep out the beautiful daylight , and makes himself an artificial night .	He brings himself up His books in his neck , To use his full eyes to the fair Bassanio , and makes himself an immediate king .
My noble uncle , do you know why he acts this way ?	My noble uncle , do you know why he hath done this way ?
I don't know , and he won't tell me .	I pray you , and he shall tell me .
Have you done everything you could to make him tell you the reason ?	Have you done 't I could make you leave him To make the reason ?
I hope you're lucky enough to hear the true story by sticking around .	I hope thou hast deceived to the least true by the tribe .
Are you gone like that , my love , my lord ?	Are you gone like that , my lord , my love ?
Oh , by this count I'll be many years older before I see my Romeo again .	Oh , by this side I be more goodly enterprise That I saw my tent not again .
Farewell !	Farewell !
I won't miss any chance to send my love to you .	I shall miss any chance to send my love to you .
Oh , do you think we'll ever meet again ?	O , do you think That never should sleep again ?
Oh God , I have a soul that predicts evil things !	O God , I have a soul that evil creatures do us !
Now that you are down there , you look like someone dead in the bottom of a tomb .	Now that you are down there , you look like how much the sight of a nightingale .
Either my eyesight is failing me , or you look pale .	Either my lord is troubled , And you look pale with you .
And trust me , love , you look pale to me too .	And trust me , love , you look pale to me too .
Sadness takes away our color .	Conceit unto her sit .
Goodbye , Goodbye !	Light , ha !
Oh luck , luck .	Oh e'en , Jew .
Everyone says you can't make up your mind .	Thus says you shall make up your mind .
I hope maybe then you'll send him back home soon .	I hope then Shall send thee home again .
Who's that calling ?	Who's that ?
Is it my mother ?	Is it my mother ?
What strange reason could she have for coming here ?	What strange reason could not for age come from here ?
What's going on , Juliet ?	What's 't on , rogue ?
Madam , I am not well .	Madam , I am not well .
Will you cry about your cousin's death forever ?	Will you cry in your face so friends ?
Are you trying to wash him out of his grave with tears ?	Are you crept to him out of his grave with tears ?
If you could , you couldn't bring him back to life .	If you could , you shall bring him back to life .
So stop crying .	So sit crying .
A little bit of grief shows a lot of love .	A little salt of nature shows a subject of love .
Let me keep weeping for such a great loss .	Let me keep weeping for such a great presence .
You will feel the loss , but the man you weep for will feel nothing .	You will feel the loss , but the man you weep for fear of all kindness .
Feeling the loss like this , I can't help but weep for him forever .	Searching the loss like this , I shall not weep for thee straight .
Well , girl , you're weeping not for his death as much as for the fact that the villain who killed him is still alive .	Well , girl , thou hast enchanted her for his death As much as for the issue That the Venetian man That killed him still alive .
What villain , madam ?	What villain , madam ?
That villain , Romeo .	That villain , lad .
That's because the murderer is alive .	That's but the Pyramus come in .
Yes , madam , he lies beyond my reach .	Ay , madam , he lies upon my tent .
I wish that no one could avenge my cousin's death except me !	I wish that no one could pronounce my father's death And kill thee !
Stop crying .	Lear's shadow .
I'll send a man to Mantua , where that exiled rogue is living .	I'll send a man to divine , who knows that Pyramus is thus sad .
And then , I hope , you'll be satisfied .	And then , I hope , you'll be satisfied .
I'll never be satisfied with Romeo until I see him .	I'll never be satisfied with bootless ears than I see him .
Madam , if you can find a man to deliver the poison , I'll mix it myself so that Romeo will sleep quietly soon after he drinks it .	Madam , if you can find a man to catch the watch , To it myself so graciously that will sleep so soon after he ) it .
I want to take the love I had for my cousin and take it out on the body of the man who killed him .	I do to take the love I had but for my cousin take it out And take the soul of the man who killed him .

What is this blood that stains the stony entrance of this tomb ?	What is this blood that ties the golden house of this tomb ?

Where is my husband ?	Where is my husband ?
I remember very well where I should be , and here I am .	I remember very well where I should be , and I am here .
Where is my Romeo ?	Where is my slippers ?
I hear some noise .	I hear some noise .
Lady , come out of the tomb .	Lady , come out of the tomb .
A greater power than we can fight has ruined our plan .	A greater power than we can fight our counsel again .
Come , come away .	Come , come away .
Your husband lies dead there , and Paris too .	Your husband lies dead there , and meaner man .
Come , I'll place you among the sisterhood of holy nuns .	Come , I'll place you i ' th ' ability .

Rust inside my body and let me die .	Fetch forth my body and let me die .
This is the place .	This is the place .
There , where the torch is burning .	There , where the morn is backward .
The ground is bloody .	The ground is bloody .
This is a pitiful sight !	This is a delicate sight !
Go , tell the Prince .	Go , tell the Prince .
Run to the Capulets .	Run to the Tower .
Wake up the Montagues .	Wake up the fairest .
Have some others search .	Have some power they .
Here's Romeo's man .	Here's thyself divine .
We found him in the churchyard .	We found him in the pit .
Hold him in custody until the Prince gets here .	Hold him in hand ; I'll be the Prince .
Here is a friar who's trembling , sighing and weeping .	Here is a arrant fool , Signor Benedick , and good .
We took this pickax and this shovel from him , as he was walking from this side of the graveyard .	We took this duty and more from him , And he from all this side Upon the Tiber of the realm .

Hold the friar too .	Hold the blessed man .
What crimes happen so early in the morning that I have to wake up before the usual time ?	What purpose thou so near the morning that I have to wake up When the new thing he came to me ?
What's the problem , that they cry out so loud ?	What's the matter , that they perceive so pale ?
Some people in the street are crying "Romeo." Some are crying "Juliet , " and some are crying "Paris." They're all running in an open riot toward our tomb .	Some people in the tomb Are stol'n forth of these stars , And some fresh fellow are gone in all our winter's flaw From down an oyster and the stars .
Investigate how this foul murder came about .	Perchance how this foul murder did bring .
Oh heavens !	O heavens !
Oh wife , look at how our daughter bleeds !	O wife , look at our worst request ?
That knife should be in its sheath on that Montague's back , but instead it's mis-sheathed in my daughter's breast .	That knife thou canst not in his purse that Come hither , And wear nothing in my daughter's flight .
Oh my !	O my follies !

Oh , my liege , my wife died tonight .	O my liege , my wife died of me .
Sadness over my son's exile stopped her breath .	Out upon my censure her withered gown .
What further pain must I endure in my old age ?	What further remove To her but in my age ?
Look , and you'll see .	Look , and you'll see .
And then I'll be the leader of pain , and maybe I'll lead you as far as death .	And then I'll be the jewel of war , And thereto hold it for a fairer death And change their loss .
In the meantime , hold on , and be patient .	In the meantime , hold on a house , and be patient .
I am the greatest , but I was able to do the least .	I am the greatest , but I was able to do the least .

I will be brief because I'm not going to live long enough to tell a boring story .	I will be brief , And be not going to live long enough to make a story .
In the meantime I wrote to Romeo and told him to come here on this awful night to help remove her from her temporary grave when the sleeping potion wore off .	In the meantime I came to blame and told him to come on this day To light to help her from her grave From the grave Which sleeping drops on Harfleur .

I can only repeat what I've said before .	I can not budge till I have done .
My daughter is still very young .	My daughter is still most deceived .
She's not even fourteen years old .	She's not even counterfeit upon one .
Girls younger than she often marry and become happy mothers .	Best than private Shall she but thus sweet men do .
Girls who marry so young grow up too soon .	Belike she did marry so young night itself .
But go ahead and charm her , gentle Paris ; make her love you .	But go forth and charm , Your dear cousin , make her content thee all .
Tonight I'm having a feast that we've celebrated for many years .	Thus were I having a feast that e'er were borne for many years .
