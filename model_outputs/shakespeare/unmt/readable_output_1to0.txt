A jumbled confession can only receive a jumbled absolution .	A rarer action never told thee a little before .
I love rich Capulet's daughter .	I love thy soul still .
We're bound to each other in every possible way , except we need you to marry us .	Set you to each other in this time , To make sure we know them not to offend us .
I'll tell you more later about when and where we met , how we fell in love , and how we exchanged promises , but now I'm begging you : please , agree to marry us today .	I'll tell thee more of this mirth when we sit on ourselves , And how in our affection , we know how we Determine and well , To tell us your commandment here .
Holy Saint Francis , this is a drastic change !	O Saint Jamy , a horse is this !
Have you given up so quickly on Rosaline , whom you loved so much ?	Have you drawn to meet so near , That I , so much feared to that ?
Then young men love with their eyes , not with their hearts .	Then young men with their love , they have not their office .
The groans you used to make are still ringing in my old ears .	The Tower shall make thee free , And thou hast only honest men in my heart .
There's still a stain on your cheek from an old tear that hasn't been washed off yet .	There's still a charm upon your forehead , A poor man that keeps from thy enmity .
If you were ever yourself , and this sadness was yours , you and your sadness were all for Rosaline .	If you were ever wed , O this courtesy , this honor you , and all your heart were in and all .
And now you've changed ?	And now she comes ?
Then repeat this after me : you can't expect women to be faithful when men are so unreliable .	Then this cuff is but you bring me thus ; they are not friends , so much as you are .
You scolded me often for loving Rosaline .	You appeared to me for giving her present .
I scolded you for obsessing about her , not for loving her , my student .	I conjure you for her , for her sake , not for my remembrance , my loving lord .
And you told me to bury my love .	And you told me to be near my mother .
I didn't tell you to get rid of one love and replace her with another .	I did not bid you to ask of you , and some of her will have another part .
Please , I beg you , don't scold me .	Pray you , I pray you , tell me .
The other girl did not love me .	The other eye doth love me so .
Oh , she knew very well that you were acting like you were in love without really knowing what love means .	Oh , she was very much glad that you were not in love or not what you do know in love .
But come on , inconsistent young man , come with me .	But come on , good uncle , look upon the tale .
Let's get out of here .	Let's get out of here .
I'm in a rush .	It is a high-wrought flood .
Go wisely and slowly .	Go and wisely .
Those who rush stumble and fall .	Those who are Ancient Pistol and him .
Where the devil can Romeo be ?	Where the devil shall be thee ?
Didn't he come home last night ?	Came he not to him well ?
Not to his father's house .	Not to his brother .
I asked a servant .	I a drum and queen .
That fair-skinned , hard-hearted hussy , Rosaline is going to torment him until he goes insane .	That , moreover , The flat transgression of the sea , fly , And mark he is not .
Tybalt , old Capulet's nephew , has sent a letter to Romeo's father's house .	News , old Queen , You have a suit to come on Sunday first .
I bet it's a challenge .	I am furnished with him .
Romeo will answer the challenge .	He will answer the will .
Any man who knows how to write can answer a letter .	Any man who knows how to answer himself than write to thy husband .
No , Romeo will respond to the letter's writer , telling him whether he accepts the challenge .	No , will we all gather to the Tower , To answer him , if he be the chain .
Oh , poor Romeo !	O most unhappy strumpet !
Is he man enough at this point to face off with Tybalt ?	Is he not enough of this time To stop the value with your sword and I can not break to me ?
Why , what's Tybalt's story ?	Why , what's the matter ?
He knows what ?	He knows not ?
He looks skinny , like a dried herring without its eggs , and he hasn't got his girl .	He looks like a schoolboy , like a dropped acorn , and his own eyes drop on top of toe .
O flesh , flesh , you've turned pale and weak like a fish .	O mighty power , This falls into the Nile Of most delicious poison .
Now he's ready for	Now he's ready .
Good morning to you both .	Good morrow to you both .
What do you mean I faked you out ?	What do you mean , I care of him ?
You gave us the slip , sir , the slip .	You gave the meat , sir , the third of the world .
Can't you understand what I'm saying ?	Know you not what you say ?
The Right .	The cockerel .
My employer is as good as yours .	My estate is as good as a princely nature .
But he's not better than mine .	But 'tis not so foul .
Well then .	Well then .
You lie .	You lie .
Gregory , remember how to slash .	Hark , sir , how comes to .
What ?	What ?
Come break this up , Benvolio .	Come this iron , up of this .
I'm losing this duel of wits .	It is a poison of his wits .
Keep going , keep going , or I'll declare myself the winner .	Keep thou not advised , I will keep myself for the mouth of the world .
You have more wild goose in one of your jokes than I have in five of mine .	You have more wild Than a toy in one of your flock and Lancaster than I have heard of .
Was I even close to you in the chase for the goose ?	Was I not much in debt to you for the honey , not for the sake of a man ?
You were never with me for anything if you weren't there for the goose .	You were never seen with me for ever but you are the better Roman .
I'll bite you on the ear for that joke .	I'll ne'er attend you on the trouble for a husband .
No , good goose , don't bite me .	No , good e'en , weep .
Your joke is a very bitter apple .	Thy conceit is very red with you .
Your humor is a spicy sauce .	Your reproof is being a proper man .
Then isn't it just the right dish for a sweet goose ?	Then is it not the right for a beggar , not for my sake ?
Oh , that's a joke made out of leather that spreads itself thin , from the width of an inch to as fat as a yard .	Oh , that's a strange tale that keeps out of the burning hell , Th ' advised head of his nativity to me as a tribute , which , as thou didst .
I stretch my joke for that word "fat." If you add that word to the word "goose , " it shows that you are a fat goose .	I know my personal displeasure for that word , Unless you will drink that word with the word , How that thou didst , it is a better soldier .
Why , isn't all this joking better than groaning about love ?	Why , is this all this better than thou dost love me ?
Now you're sociable .	Now thou liest .
Now you're Romeo .	Now thou liest .
Oh , you're wrong .	O thou art damned .
I would have made it short .	I would have made it short .
I had come to the deepest part of my tale , and I planned to say nothing more on the topic .	I had come to the part of my bond , And I to say "Amen" to the Moor .
Here's something good .	Here's something good .
There's two , a man and a woman .	There's two , but a fool and no woman .
Peter !	Peter !
I'm at your service .	It is your part .
Give me my fan , Peter .	Give me my robe , from the duke .
Good morning , gentlemen .	Good morrow , masters .
Good afternoon , fair lady .	Good afternoon , fair lady .
Is it now afternoon ?	Is 't not now ?
It's not earlier than that , I tell you .	Tis not so bad that I know of her .
The Get out of here !	The messengers upon this fiend !
What kind of man are you ?	What kind of god art thou ?
I'm a man , my lady , that God has made for himself to ruin .	It is a lady , my lord , that God himself gives way to himself .
I swear , you speak the truth .	I prithee , tell me the truth .
For himself to ruin , " he says .	For himself to praise , he says .
Gentlemen , can any of you tell me where I can find young Romeo ?	Gentlemen , can not any of you tell me what I can call you but a little chain ?
I can tell you , but young Romeo will be older when you find him than he was when you started looking for him .	I can not tell , but young men be so many a men To die when he dies , for you must lay him when he is .
I am the youngest man by that name , because there is no one younger , or worse .	I am the son of any man that knows , there is no one , or no more than old .
You speak well .	You speak not well .
Is the worst well ?	Is the news well ?
Very well taken , I believe , very wise .	Very well , I know , of it .
She will A pimp !	She will purchase me !
I've found it out .	Thou shalt see me .
What have you found out ?	What have you seen me ?
Romeo , are you going to your father's for lunch ?	Fellow , are you going to rest your bride and feed ?
Let's go there .	Let's go there .
I'll follow after you .	I'll follow you .
He says more in one minute than he does in a whole month .	He says in one more particular than he does , in a wild world .
If he says anything against me , I'll humble him , even if he were stronger than he is , and twenty punks like him .	If he do deny him , I'll weep thee , For he hath none , but twenty times , for he understands not any .
If I can't do it myself , I'll find someone who can .	If I do not find it myself , I'll find him find it .
That dirty rat !	That Herod's swain !
I'm not one of his sluts .	It is not one of his nuptial .
I'm not one of his punk friends who carries a knife .	It is not one of his friends That he loves me .
I didn't see anybody use you for kicks .	I did not see your lips for the dangers make you .
If I had seen something like that , I would have quickly pulled out my weapon .	If I had seen that , like I would have met Cassio and my hair to be found .
Believe me , I'll draw my sword as quick as any other man if I see a fight starting and the law is on my side .	Believe me , I'll take my sword a quarrel as far as I can see a fight of a day And turn the seal of my sword .
Now , I swear , I'm so angry that I'm shaking all over .	Now , I prithee , so am I in Egypt all be so pleasant .
That rotten scoundrel !	That wicked soldier !
Nurse , give my regards to to your lady .	Bid my bond give you to your friend , Cassio .
I swear to you , You have a good heart , and believe me , I'll tell her that .	I pray you , sir , have a good heart , and for me that I will tell thee .
Lord , Lord , she'll be a happy woman .	Lord , Lord , what captain is with him .
What are you going to tell her , Nurse ?	What sayst thou to me , Cassius , what's the end ?
You're not paying attention to me .	Thou art not enough to catch his time .
At Friar Lawrence's cell she can make confession and be married .	At Crosby Place , she shall make thee a wife and be patient .
Wait good Nurse .	Tarry , good gentleman .
Within an hour , one of my men will come to you behind the abbey wall and give you a rope ladder .	Within an hour of my one , I will come to you and came back to the mart , I will give you a instructions to you .
Goodbye .	Adieu .
Be honest and helpful , and I'll repay you for your efforts .	Be honest , and I'll tame you , for your pains .
Goodbye .	Adieu .
Sing my praises to your mistress .	Report my exhortation after dinner .
May God in heaven bless you .	May God in heaven be brought .
Now please listen , sir .	Now please , adieu .
What do you have to say , my dear Nurse ?	What do you have to say , my dear ?
Can your man keep a secret ?	Can not your person speak ?
Haven't you ever heard the saying , "Two can conspire to put one away" ?	Had you ever known the cause , Emilia , To make a bondmaid and a slave to mine ?
I assure you , my man is as true as steel .	I assure you , my lord , as long as it is .
Well , sir , my mistress is the sweetest lady .	Well , sir , my mistress is the lady .
Lord , Lord , when she was a little baby , Oh , there is one nobleman in the city , a guy named Paris , who would be happy to claim her as his own .	Lord Lord , " when she was a queen , she is one indeed , the phoenix ' heir , here is a prince in his own person , would not be her .
I make her angry sometimes by saying that Paris is more handsome than you are .	I make her live by thinking that thou hast been more than a child .
But when I say so , I swear she turns white as a sheet .	But when I say , I am so bold as to catch a cat .
Don't " Yes , Nurse , what about that ?	Budge not , " quoth I , Myself have the first ?
They both begin with the letter "R." Ah , you jokester , that's the dog's name .	They both begin the letter with the sovereign , And that's the fear of the world , he frowns .
Give my compliments to your lady .	Give my regards to you .
Yes , a thousand times .	Ay , a thousand times .
Peter !	Peter !
I'm ready .	It is gone .
I sent the Nurse at nine o'clock .	I sent the lunatic king , at home .
Maybe she can't find him .	Perchance she shall make me .
That can't be .	That can not be .
Oh , she's slow !	Oh , rarely base !
Love's messengers should be thoughts , which fly ten times faster than sunbeams .	One consequence should be , which I have almost fly , For half my heart is .
That's three hours since nine o'clock , but she hasn't come back .	That's three hours nor time , but she doth come again .
If she was young and passionate , she'd move as fast as a ball .	If she was young and sullen , The dowry shall most as they do .
My words would bounce her to my sweet love , and his words would bounce her back to me .	My words would move her to my own love , And make her rich and his friends would be pleased with me .
But a lot of old people act like they're already dead , sluggish , slow , fat , and colorless , like lead .	But a proper father of old age , and he , Are free , and red , shall suffocate , or else , thou shalt not .
Oh sweet Nurse , what news do you bring ?	O sweet mermaid , what news do you play ?
Have you spoken to him ?	Have you not spoken to him ?
Send your man away .	Send your word too .
Peter , wait for me at the gate .	Good sir , stay by me at the gate .
Now , good sweet Nurse , Oh Lord , why do you look so sad ?	Now , good my good Lord , Why do you mean so , my old friend ?
Even if the news is sad , tell me with a smile on your face .	Even if the news be sad , tell me , see , with a brief means .
If the news is good , you're ruining the sweet news by playing a trick with a sour face like that .	If the news be fair , the Jills good by makes a face , but being troubled with a peacock feather .
I am tired .	I am weary .
Leave me alone for a minute .	Leave me alone , good Kate .
Oh my , my bones ache so much .	O my lord , Your cousin hath wronged me so much .
I wish you had my bones , and I had your news .	I wish you had , my lord , and had your news too .
Can't you wait for a moment ?	Know you not a man ?
Don't you see that I'm out of breath ?	Dost thou see me then of the issue ?
How can you be out of breath when you have enough breath to tell me that you're out of breath ?	How can you be out of breath and when you have patience , To tell me that she is not so foul ?
The excuse you make to delay the news is longer than the news itself .	The excuse you do not have to know the truth , But much is not natural news .
Is the news good or bad ?	Is the news good of bad ?
Answer that question .	Answer that question .
Tell me if it's good or bad , and I'll wait for the details .	Tell me but 'tis good , or I'll have no more , for I'll repair to hear my speech with me .
Tell me so I can be satisfied .	Tell me so I can be satisfied .
Is it good or bad ?	Is it good or bad ?
Well , you have made a foolish choice .	Well , you have a little wit .
You don't know how to pick a man .	You know not how to pray you do it .
Romeo ?	Favors ?
No , not him , though his face is more handsome than any man's , and his legs are prettier , and as for his hands and feet and body , they're not much to speak of , and yet they're beyond compare .	No , not yet , though his tongue is more musical , than his solicitings , As many dolors for his valor , and bounds of feasts and his subjects , Which they are not well To have seen and seen , and yet .
He's not the most polite man in the world , but , believe me , he's gentle as a lamb .	He's not the most unkind power in the world , Nor in the world , but as much as a soldier .
Well , do what you want .	Well , do you what I will .
Be good .	Be good .
Have you had lunch yet ?	Have you had seen dinner ?
No , I haven't had lunch .	No , I have not cause .
Everything you told me I already knew .	Everything you told me I was here .
What does he say about our marriage ?	What says he , to th ' other ?
What about that ?	What noise is that ?
My head is pounding .	My head is embarked .
My back aches too ,	My countenance upon it , too much .
Believe me , I'm sorry you're in pain .	Believe me , thou woeful hour of mine .
Sweet , sweet , sweet Nurse , tell me , what did my love Romeo say ?	Sweet sweet , sweet Katherine , will not tell me , my love , what does he say ?
Your love says , like an honorable gentleman , who is courteous , kind , handsome , and , I believe , virtuous , where is your mother ?	Your love , an honest man is a kind , sullen , and , sullen , tender , and , adieu , what , is your Rosalind ?
Where is my mother ?	Where is my wife ?
Why , she's inside .	Why , ay , thou liest .
Where else would she be ?	Where else she calls thee ?
Your answer is so strange !	Your answer is so true !
Your love says , like an honorable gentleman , 'Where is your mother ?	Thy love , an honest man , is your very pregnant and honorable gentleman ?
Are you this impatient ?	Are you this same ?
Come on , you're being ridiculous !	Come , thou art raw , and
Is this the cure for my aching bones ?	Is this the prize for my brother's purpose ?
From now on , take care of your messages yourself .	From now , take thy note , You have forsworn him .
You're making such a fuss .	Thou art a soldier only .
Come on , what did Romeo say ?	Come , what did we say ?
Do you have permission to go out and take confession today ?	Do you have spoken to my house and take your course of me ?
I do .	I do .
Then hurry up and rush over to Friar Lawrence's cell .	Then stand up and down , And thou shalt die on .
There's a husband there who's waiting to make you his wife .	There's a husband left him there , And to his own cause .
Now I see the blood rushing to your cheeks .	Now I see the law to your own mercy .
You blush bright red as soon as you hear any news .	You lusty bright and trembling Do as make thee melancholy .
Go to the church .	Go to the gate .
Your love will use it to climb up to your window while it's dark .	Your love will use it to your own use And bear to be a smile when the idle words .
Go .	Go .
I'll go to lunch .	I'll to billiards .
You go to Friar Lawrence's cell .	You go to prison , and fill them .
I'm only trying to keep the peace .	It is not turns of small regard .
Either put away your sword or use it to help me stop this fight .	Either put away your sword for use of fortune , And let me go with thee .
What ?	What ?
I hate the word peace like I hate hell , all Montagues , and you .	I hate the word of God , I am sorry , Since all the gods are not so good .
Let's go at it , coward !	Let's go , bind , look !
Use your clubs and spears !	Use your Worship well , man .
Hit them !	Part them !
Beat them down !	Beat him up !
Down with the Capulets !	Down with the topmast !
Down with the Montagues !	Down with the topmast !
What's this noise ?	Wherefore is this ?
I want my sword .	I do my daughter .
Old Montague is here , and he's waving his sword around just to make me mad .	Old Gloucester is here , And his wife's here comes to make his offense But thou didst .
Capulet , you villain !	Avaunt , you cullions !
You're not taking one step toward an enemy .	Thou art not in the slightest eye that mind .
Wish me luck .	Despise me well .
Thank you , dear Nurse .	Fare you well , Jessica .
Amen , amen .	Amen , say .
But whatever misfortunes occur , they can't ruin the joy I feel with one look at her .	But lest thou wert remembered , I could not part the better of them , I am not one .
Therefore , love each other in moderation .	Therefore , by mine own , thou art mine .
That is the key to long-lasting love .	That is the key of our love .
Too fast is as bad as too slow .	Too late is with the very valiant , indeed .
Here comes the lady .	Here comes the lady .
Oh , a footstep as light as hers will never endure the rocky road of life .	Oh , a light as a maid , That could not endure the tyrant's merit that part of a lady's nature .
That's how flimsy and unreal pleasure is .	That's how high and plenteous wit and steel .
Romeo will thank you , my girl , for both of us .	I will thank you , my sovereign , and all of us .
I'll give him equal thanks , so we're even .	I'll give him thanks for his own cause , if not I can .
Ah , Juliet if you're as happy as I am , and you're better with words , tell me about the happiness you imagine we'll have in our marriage .	Ah , thou canst not live as much as thou art , I have seen more bold than love , And let me see the current Of parents that should be their office .
I can imagine more than I can say , I have more on my mind than words .	I can not choose much more than I have , I have done my tongue upon my love .
Come , come with me , and we'll do the job quickly .	Come , come , with us , and we'll follow him .
I'm begging you , good Mercutio , let's call it a day .	It is a good silling , And you may call it a little credit .
You're like one of those guys who walks into a bar , slams his sword on the table , and then says , "I pray I never have to use you." By the time he orders his second drink , he pulls his sword on the bartender for no reason at all .	Twas like one of those crisped snaky golden locks of gold , to catch his rage , What , and then , I pray , God , have the time to leave the present , And he himself must hold his name for no reason at all .
Am I really like one of those guys ?	Am I not a man at the height of one ?
Come on , you can be as angry as any guy in Italy when you're in the mood .	Come , you can not be as angry as any emperor in the country ; he is in the commonwealth , as many .
And what about that ?	And what of that ?
If there were two men like you , pretty soon there'd be none because the two of you would kill each other .	If there were two cousins not , for two part of yours , two hundred and those long-suffering weaklings who use him not .
You would fight with a man if he had one more whisker or one less whisker in his beard than you have in your beard .	You would with a man simply if he had one more child , or his two more in Christendom Than if not in his ventures failed .
You'll fight with a man who's cracking nuts just because you have hazelnut-colored eyes .	You'll fight with a Frenchman so knows the truth , And not you have spoke the truth .
Only you would look for a fight like that .	Only you would look for a man of death .
Your head is as full of fights as an egg is full of yolk , but your head has been beaten like scrambled eggs from so much fighting .	Your head is full of black behavior , as full of valor , but twenty times of death , Like a second hour , and so far That I have lost thee .
You started a fight with a man who coughed in the street because he woke up a dog that was sleeping in the sun .	You seek a quarrel with a suitor , And there he spends in the park borders and shocks that death , that the king himself was foul .
Didn't you argue it out with your tailor for wearing one of his new suits before the right season ?	Think'st thou it is not possible with the honorable men That for his own cause , the very Athenian one of it ?
And with another for tying the new shoes he made with old laces ?	And with another subject That he should make the lion stay with me in an oyster ?
And yet you're the one who wants to teach me about restraint !	And yet the man doth one daughters witness To know about it .
If I were in the habit of fighting the way you are , my life insurance rates would be sky high .	If I were in the eye of this , You would not have lost the bosom That may be lamented , pitied and excused Of every hearer .
Your life insurance ?	Thy life ?
That's foolish .	That's most convenient .
Oh great , here come the Capulets .	O great day , come here in the marketplace .
Well , well , I don't care .	Well , well , I will do .
Put it together with something else .	Put it down with reason .
Make it a word and a blow .	Make it a word , and so am I .
You'll find me ready enough to do that , sir , if you give me a reason .	You'll find me ready , for that thou shalt give me , And give me a little answer , lest that .
Can't you find a reason without my giving you one ?	Know you not a little question of my brother's ?
Mercutio , you hang out with Romeo .	Home , you temporize with the air .
Hang out ? " Who do you think we are , musicians in a band ?	Hang thou there , " When think we are , you are in an onion to the world ?
If we look like musicians to you , you can expect to hear nothing but noise .	If we look like you to look , you shall hear him , but not to look at odds .
We're talking here in a public place .	Set you down here , good night .
Either go someplace private , or talk it over rationally , or else just go away .	Either go not or borrow us , or else it is , or else you go not .
Out here everybody can see us .	Out , here thou shalt see .
Men's eyes were made to see things , so let them watch .	These eyes were made to see , they are not made revenge .
I won't move to please anybody .	I shall chide thee , sir .
Well , may peace be with you .	Well , peace be with you .
Here comes my man , the man I'm looking for .	Here comes my man , the man is well .
He's not your man .	He's not thy kinsman .
Tybalt , I have a reason to love you that lets me put aside the rage I should feel and excuse that insult .	Verona , I have a reason to scorn me and let me fly , For I must hold your Majesties To take upon my post .
I am no villain .	I am no villain .
So , goodbye .	So , adieu .
I can tell that you don't know who I am .	I can tell that you are not who I am .
Boy , your words can't excuse the harm you've done to me .	Boy , thy love doth laugh The color of her shame .
So now turn and draw your sword .	So now I'll turn thy sword and thy daughters .
And so , good Capulet , which is a name I love like my own name , you should be satisfied with what I say .	And so , good liege , which is a name so dear a man I should be with you , I say , I say .
This calm submission is dishonorable and vile .	This cold wind is like a deadly fashion .
What do you want from me ?	What do you mean by me ?
Will you pull your sword out of its sheath ?	Will you your turn into your sword and your followers ?
Hurry up , or I'll smack you on the ears with my sword before you have yours drawn .	Up , or I'll bar thee in my pocket , Upon the last oak you let her attend my house .
I'll fight you .	I'll fight you .
Noble Mercutio , put your sword away .	Noble lady , put thy sword back .
Let's get away , Tybalt .	Let's get away , madam .
I've been hurt .	Thou hast hit .
May a plague curse both your families .	May a plague work upon your earliest .
I'm finished .	It is gone .
Did he get away clean ?	Did he not get gone ?
What , are you hurt ?	What , are you hurt ?
But it's enough .	But 'tis more .
Where is my page ?	Where is my slippers ?
Have courage , man .	Have patience , dear .
The wound can't be that bad .	The greatest cunning can not be lost .
No , it's not as deep as a well , or as wide as a church door , but it's enough .	No , 'tis not as 'twere a day as 'twere a day , As a rough night as a crab is .
Ask for me tomorrow , and you'll find me in a grave .	Ask me for patience , and you'll find me in a place .
I'm done for in this world , I believe .	It is well in this world , I believe , in spite of mirth .
May a plague strike both your houses .	May a plague strike too far !
I can't believe that dog , that rat , that mouse , that cat could scratch me to death !	I dare not believe that , sir , that some lame woman could not bear me into my tongue !
That braggart , punk villain who fights like he learned swordsmanship from a manual !	That , slave , That play'st so subtly with a strain , The body's delicate in my complexion !
Why the hell did you come in between us ?	Why the hell did you come from me ?
He struck me from under your arm .	He stays me by your arm .
I thought it was the right thing to do .	I thought it was the time to do it .
Take me inside some house , Benvolio , or I'll pass out .	Take me some ink and paper , I'll bear thee With a double kiss .
May a plague strike both your families !	May a plague strike me thy most noble wars !
They've turned me into food for worms .	They have tied me to the jail .
I'm done for .	It is well done .
Curse your families !	Bless thy soul !
Oh Romeo , Romeo , brave Mercutio is dead !	O ill-starred wench , Pale with thy bloody body !
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again .	Here comes the herald to the changes .
He's alive and victorious , and Mercutio's dead ?	He's dead , and yet the dead ?
Either you , or I , or both of us have to go with him .	Either you , or I , or have none of us to seek him .
Wretched boy , you hung out with him here , and you're going to go to heaven with him .	Enobarbus boy , you have gone with me , And here thou mayst go with thee to thy charge .
This fight will decide who dies .	This will we feel fly and .
Romeo , get out of here .	Go , get thee gone .
The citizens are around , and Tybalt is dead .	The revelers are entering , brother , and is dead .
Don't stand there shocked .	Bear it away .
The Prince will give you the death penalty if you get caught .	The Prince will give you the death of this if you keep mocking me .
So get out of here !	So get thee hence in hence !
Why are you waiting ?	Why are you grown ?
The man who killed Mercutio , which way did he go ?	The man who killed me there , shall he not fall ?
Tybalt , that murderer , which way did he run ?	Wherefore , that cried , That ceremony not ?
Tybalt is lying over there .	The fiend is mad .
Speak , nephew .	Speak , Agrippa .
Were you here when it started ?	Were you here when it comes to hell ?
Where are the evil men who started this fight ?	Where are the parents of this war Do you know ?
Oh , noble prince , I can tell you everything about the unfortunate circumstances of this deadly fight .	O noble prince , I can not tell thee of the quality o ' th ' earth .
He killed your relative , brave Mercutio , and then young Romeo killed him .	He killed your father's dead , and brave , And then hath ta'en a humble gold to see him .
Tybalt was my nephew !	I was my lord !
He was my brother's son !	He was my brother's son !
Oh cousin , cousin !	O cousin , cousin !
Benvolio , who started this fight ?	O , who shall this fight ?
Romeo cried out , "Stop , my friends .	Behold , cried , my haste , stand up .
Break it up." Then he jumped in between them and forced them to put their swords down .	Hath it sterile with ale , and in their summer Make fall them forth to th' air .
Before I could break up the fight , Tybalt was killed .	Before I could break up , I were the last woman in your heart .
Romeo ran away when Tybalt fell dead .	He ran away when it is dead .
Benvolio is part of the Montague family .	This is the part of the sea .
He's not telling the truth .	He's not the answer of it .
There were twenty Montagues fighting in this awful riot , and together those twenty could only kill one man .	There were many lions legs in this forest , And there could not choose one could not kill any woman in the world .
You , Prince , are the man who can give me justice .	You , Prince , are the hangers one , which doth give me justice .
Romeo killed Tybalt .	Here comes Oberon .
Romeo must die .	We must die .
Romeo killed Tybalt .	Here comes Oberon .
Who should now pay the price for Mercutio's life ?	Who should now cover the Kate for this present grove ?
His crime did justice's job by taking Tybalt's life .	His beard did withhold me by the practice of heaven .
I'm involved in your rivalry .	It is in your comfort .
I'll punish you so harshly that you'll regret causing me this loss .	I'll not trouble thee so that thou shalt kill me , who is this vile woman .
I won't listen to your pleas or excuses .	I shall content thee to your gossip-like humor .
You can't get out of trouble by praying or crying , so don't bother .	You can not turn out of fear , Nor came so much upon the bond .
Take away this body , and do what I say .	Take away this body , and do not I say .
Showing mercy by pardoning killers only causes more murders .	I mercy by slanderous words , no more than we have .
Or else love is blind , and its best time is the night .	Or else is love , and every time is not the very button .
I wish night would come , like a widow dressed in black , so I can learn how to submit to my husband and lose my virginity .	I wish you would not come , Come so , in a duck To see how much I am my husband and my husband to my son-in-law .
Let the blood rushing to my cheeks be calmed .	Let the tears be my lent , With all the rest .
Come , night .	Come , come .
Come , Romeo .	Come , instance .
You're whiter than snow on the black wings of a raven .	Thou art as opposite as the water from the field .
His face will make the heavens so beautiful that the world will fall in love with the night and forget about the garish sun .	His face will make the traitors hear that will , The guilty will fall in fear and will not fight with the trees by foul .
Is that the rope ladder Romeo told you to pick up ?	Is that the chain that told you of me to serve you ?
Yes , yes , this is the rope ladder .	Ay , ay , this is the garland of the realm .
Oh my , what's the news ?	Oh , my Lord , what's going on ?
Why do you look so upset ?	Why do you look so ?
He's dead .	He's dead .
We're ruined , lady , we're ruined !	Set on , sweet Kate , and cheer !
What an awful day !	What an irreplaceable of kingdom !
Can God be so jealous and hateful ?	Can not be God so high and rash ?
Romeo is hateful , even though God isn't .	Sword" is no hornmaker , And yet would hurt me .
What kind of devil are you to torture me like this ?	What kind of god hast thou to me ?
This is as bad as the tortures of hell .	This is as bad as the weather of a Christian .
Has Romeo killed himself ?	Wilt thou have bed ?
Just say "Yes" and I will turn more poisonous than the snake with the evil eye .	Therefore say I will , and I will turn more than the Jew with the other eye .
If he's been killed , say "Yes." If not , say "No." These short words will determine my joy or my pain .	If thou hast been slain , say you , thou hast not such charity as thy words , But my dog will drown me .
I'll send my eyes to prison , and they'll never be free to look at anything again .	I'll send my goblins , Give me my key , and be gone thus to hate him .
I'll give my vile body back to the earth .	I'll give my body to the set of the earth .
Oh , Tybalt , Tybalt , he was the best friend I had .	Oh , 'twas he , that he hath played the best of Cornwall .
I wish I had not lived long enough to see him die .	I wish I had not long enough to see him here .
Has Romeo been killed , and is Tybalt dead too ?	Wilt thou have breath , is not dead too late ?
Tybalt was my dearest cousin .	I was my father's father .
Tybalt is dead , and Romeo has been banished .	Thy dead and the earth , Like to thy father's self .
Oh God , did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood ?	O God , did never spring thy soul full of blood ?
It did , it did .	It did , it did not .
Curse the day this happened , but it did .	Heavens take the world but this , good morrow , And never did it .
Oh , he's like a snake disguised as a flower .	Oh , 'tis a like a whale to catch a nuptial .
Did a dragon ever hide in such a beautiful cave ?	Did not a worm ever sleep in such a night ?
He's a raven with the feathers of the dove .	He's a prisoner with the French flood of your face .
Oh nature , what were you doing in hell ?	O villainy , what makes you in this town ?
Was there ever such an evil book with such a beautiful cover ?	Was ever man in such an hour To be a sick or an odd train ?
Ah , where's my servant ? , Give me some brandy. , These griefs , these pains , these sorrows make me old .	Ah , my master , To have some boast , and thou shalt find me , And these are these precious people To make me happy .
Shame on Romeo !	Shame on thee !
I hope sores cover your tongue for a wish like that !	I hope thy soul should move for this , bear a while !
He was not born to be shameful .	He was not grown to be called .
He deserves only honor , complete honor .	He only loves her , death .
Oh , I was such a beast to be angry at him .	Oh , I was such a man as a maid to him .
Are you going to say good things about the man who killed your cousin ?	Are you not married to me of my brother's man That you did wrong me ?
But why , you villain , did you kill my cousin ?	But wherefore , you , villain , hast thou not my cousin ?
Probably because my cousin the villain would have killed my husband .	Not know my cousin That would have the Moor to my husband .
All this is comforting news .	All this is mortal .
Why , then , should I cry ?	Why , then , I should not ?
I would be glad to forget about it , but it weighs on my memory like sins linger in guilty minds .	I would be glad to see it , but I am sure of my heart , A heavy trial in my life .
Tybalt is dead , and Romeo has been banished."	His conceit is nearer death , and the other course .
That banishment is worse than the murder of ten thousand Tybalts .	That is cunning more mourning than the maid that runs out .
Tybalt's death would be bad enough if that was all .	Better death would be that if no man were in .
It would have been better if , after she said , "Tybalt's dead , " she told me my mother or my father , or both , were gone .	It would have been much , if she lives , yet she loves me , And she loves me , my mother , or in my life , or both .
But to say that Tybalt's dead and then say , "Romeo has been banished." To say that is like saying that my father , my mother , Tybalt , Romeo , and Juliet have all been killed , they're all dead .	But to say that , and then alone hath been discovered , And that thou didst say The name of my father , my father , Vincentio , have been all been seen , and all the time is dead .
Romeo has been banished." That news brings infinite death .	He hath been much o ' th ' weaker bottle .
No words can express the pain .	No words can not be heard .
Where are my father and my mother , Nurse ?	Where are my father and my fair consent ?
They are crying and moaning over Tybalt's corpse .	They are crying , and my pleasant queen adieu .
Are you going to join them ?	Are you content to use of me ?
I'll bring you there .	I'll bring you thither .
Are they washing out his wounds with their tears ?	Are they "informed" of his face with me ?
I'll cry my tears for Romeo's banishment when their tears are dry .	I'll cry my goblins at all that addition , though good night be so .
Pick up this rope ladder .	Pluck up this shame , Monster .
He made this rope ladder to be a highway to my bed , but I am a virgin , and I will die a virgin and a widow .	He hath made this extremity of pity to a bed , but I am a man , I will , and I will die a woman and a slave .
And death , not Romeo , can take my virginity !	And death , not death , my lord of Buckingham !
Go to your bedroom .	Go to your hand .
I'll find Romeo to comfort you .	I'll find thee bound to death .
I know where he is .	I know where he is .
Listen , your Romeo will be here tonight .	Hence , your soul's ambition , I'll not be here .
I'll go to him .	I'll to 't .
He's hiding out in Friar Lawrence's cell .	He's busy in the stocks , Captain Gower .
Romeo , come out .	Arise , come to me .
Come out , you frightened man .	Come , you deceive me , you are .
Father , what's the news ?	Father , is the news ?
You know too much about suffering .	You know not too much of hell .
I have news for you about the Prince's punishment .	I have news for you , no more of our nuptial .
Is the Prince's punishment any less awful than doomsday ?	Is the single man his purpose Than of his estate ?
Ha , banishment ?	Ha , ha ?
Be merciful and say "death." Exile is much worse than death .	Be merciful and say herself , a bird , and much of his death .
Don't say "banishment." From now on , you are banished from Verona .	Fear not your hatred , sir , That you are still banished , for you .
You should be able to endure this because the world is broad and wide .	You should be known to know this When the world is very hot and merry .
There is no world for me outside the walls of Verona , except purgatory , torture , and hell itself .	There is no pity for me , the thousand of Epidamnum , the most bent That , for the sea , dies for itself .
So to be banished from Verona is like being banished from the world , and being banished from the world is death .	So to be from thee That is from the very grievous creature , And the wise man from the eye of death , being so dull .
Calling death banishment is like cutting off my head with a golden ax and smiling while I'm being murdered .	Thy death sentence he is fall'n into a watery villain And with her most free touches of me .
Oh , deadly sin !	O vengeance , O vengeance !
Oh , rude and unthankful boy !	O insupportable and touching loss !
It's torture , not mercy .	Tis wonder , for it .
Flies are healthier and more honorable and better suited for romance than Romeo .	Asses are more ripe than the dead and unnatural Than for a inward feast .
Flies can kiss her , but I must flee the city .	Hope can kiss her , and I must be the slave Of all the other .
Flies are like free men , but I have been banished .	Belike they are but some honest men , I have not loved .
And yet you say that exile is not death ?	And yet you say that is not the day ?
Did you have no poison , no sharp knife , no weapon you could use to kill me quickly , nothing so disgraceful , except banishment ?	Did you no more , no maiden , no maiden , no shame To hold your praises , so far To die , for thou shalt hear , guilty conscience ?
Oh Friar , damned souls use the word banishment to describe hell .	O heavens , The heavens use me thus To be damned death !
They howl about banishment .	They vanished strangely .
If you're a member of a divine spiritual order of men who forgive sins , and you say you're my friend , how do you have the heart to mangle me with the word banishment ?	If thou takest a spirit of bated war , You will not let me say you are my friend , How do you both the friend of mine , To do the word with the other satisfaction ?
You foolish madman , listen to me for a moment .	You foolish whore , you shall be whipped for ever .
Your servants were fighting your enemy's servants before I got here .	Your servants were their honors on before , Which came to leave .
I drew my sword to part them .	I am my sword , and I will weep .
As we were trading blows , more and more people showed up to join the fight , until the Prince came and broke everyone up .	As we were bound To hand this more forked , Who seems not to the weird sisters , Whilst all the night he lies here , And not the king .
Oh , where's Romeo ?	Oh , where's the gold ?
Have you seen him today ?	Have you seen him now ?
I'm glad he wasn't here for this fight .	It is but moonlight now within the house .
I headed toward him , but he saw me coming and hid in the woods .	I attend him in , And he alone hath made me in the Paris found .
He's been seen there many mornings , crying tears that add drops to the morning dew and making a cloudy day cloudier with his sighs .	He's been seen tonight , most worthily , That to the senators are with a snaffle You may pace morning , and his behavior is ripe .
But as soon as the sun rises in the east , my sad son comes home to escape the light .	But as yet as the sun shines in my shoulder , I will not breathe the day To draw the grave to th ' party .
Oh , you're just going to talk about banishment again .	O , thou didst conclude me , thou hast lost my soul .
Don't say anything else .	Fear nothing but I .
Oh , so madmen like you are also deaf .	Oh , so many men are not so quickly .
How should madmen hear , if wise men can't even see ?	How should we hear , young man , if you can not see the truth ?
Let me talk to you about your situation .	Let me talk to you , your highness .
You can't talk about something that you don't feel .	You can not speak of that if you are not satisfied .
If you were as young as I am , if you were in love with Juliet , if you had just married her an hour ago , if then you murdered Tybalt , if you were lovesick like me , and if you were banished , then you might talk about it .	If you were as young and I am if you were in love , with what if you had not found yourself , if you had your own minds , if you were furious and even if you were a fool , you wouldn't ask you to talk about it .
Get up .	Get thee hence .
Somebody's knocking .	Somebody's knocking .
Hide yourself , good Romeo .	Advise yourself , good brother .
I won't hide unless all the mist from my heartsick groans envelopes me like fog and conceals me from people's searching eyes .	I shall laugh till my precedent purpose of all the 'orld , For my hands deceive me , and these are I from fortunes .
Why are you knocking so hard ?	Why dost thou sound thyself ?
Where do you come from ?	Where do you come from me ?
What do you want ?	What do you here ?
Oh , holy Friar , Oh , tell me , holy Friar , where is my lady's husband ?	O , most lame gods , wilt thou mock me , most noble Caesar , To be so flouted in thy name ?
Where's Romeo ?	Where's Seleucus ?
Oh , he's acting just like Juliet , just like her .	Oh , 'twas he too much of the drinking in your tail ?
Oh painful sympathy !	O heavy deed !
She's lying on the ground just like him , blubbering and weeping , weeping and blubbering .	She's the most galled from him , And so many babes , them whoreson and friendly to thee .
Stand up if you're really a man .	Stand close , thou witch ! ,
For Juliet's sake , for her sake , rise and stand up .	For heaven's sake , for her sake , stand by and eat .
Why should you fall into so deep a moan ?	Why should you bear me so in a sudden humor ?
Nurse !	Cessez !
Ah sir , ah sir .	Marry , sir , sir .
Well , death is the end for everybody .	Well , death is the end for the affairs of poor war .
Were you talking about Juliet ?	Were you born here ?
How is she ?	How is she ?
Where is she ?	Where is she ?
How is she doing ?	How is 't thou ?
What does my hidden wife say about our ruined love ?	What says my wife and our honored love ?
She's calling out my name as if I were a bullet murdering her , just like I murdered her relative .	She's fled to my house , if I were a maid , I would not wish her , but I am her prisoner .
Tell me , Friar , in what part of my body is my name embedded ?	Tell me , thou witch , what effects of death I will be With my own company ?
Tell me , so I can cut it out of myself .	Tell me , I can not let it so drown out my tongue .
Are you a man ?	Are you a man ?
Your wild actions resemble the irrational fury of a beast .	Your wild fortune is the most gilded change , Which is nothing .
You have amazed me .	You have been hotly wrong .
I swear by my holy order , I thought you were smarter and more rational than this .	I swear by my holy heart , I thought I had thought and much more than this .
Have you killed Tybalt ?	Have you killed her ?
Why do you complain about your birth , the heavens , and the earth ?	Why do you not call your difference , " the reason of our women ?
You have so much natural talent , but like someone who hoards money , you use none of your talent for the right purpose , not your body , not your love , not your mind .	You have so much ignorance , but so dear a man , who , after despite your eyes , for the other , thou hast not lost thy mind , and not thy mind , which I do not mind your mind .
Get up , man !	Get thee gone , Clitus !
Your Juliet is alive .	Thy name is Gloucester .
Tybalt wanted to kill you , but you killed Tybalt .	Thou shalt not kill me , but thou hast killed thee .
Be happy that you're alive .	Be happy that we are not .
You have the best sorts of happiness to enjoy .	You have the best armor of my brother .
But like a misbehaved , sullen girl , you're whining about your bad luck and your love .	But like a wood , an arrant knave , Give me thy hand , and desire your followers my heart .
Go be with your love , as it was decided at your wedding .	Go with your love , as it is with you , Your Majesty is not lost .
Climb up to her bedroom and comfort her .	Up to her , and after her .
Give my regards to your lady , and tell her to hurry everybody in the house to bed .	Give my regards to your lady , and tell her to the senate house , And to her bed with all her bones .
Romeo is coming .	The morn is fair .
O Lord , I could stay here all night listening to such good advice .	O Lord , I could not stand here But all good night like this , good neighbor .
Educated men are so impressive !	You men are so betrayed !
Do so , and tell my sweet to be ready to scold me .	Do so , and tell my finger you are a tyrant to me .
Here , sir , this is a ring she asked me to give you .	Here , sir , this ring is a man that gave to you me than she will give .
Hurry up , it's getting late .	Up , stand , close , curtain , Nerissa .
This makes me feel so much better !	This makes me fear , And 'tis more .
Now get out of here .	Now get thee gone .
Good night .	Good night .
Everything depends on this : either be out of here before the night watchmen take their positions , or leave in disguise after daybreak .	Everything of this shame put on To be here out of time , To have their senses in gore , or sleep , or in thy sense , for you shall hear .
Take a little vacation in Mantua .	Take a little paler and Thisbe .
I'll find your servant , and he'll update you now and then on your case as it stands here .	I'll find thee thy wife , and then I'll meet thee by your own humor , And now it is not fit .
Give me your hand .	Give me your hand .
It's late .	Tis late .
Farewell .	Farewell .
Things have turned out so unluckily , sir , that we haven't had time to convince our daughter to marry you .	Things have turned out , sir , so we had , that we have been our daughter to marry you .
Listen , she loved her cousin Tybalt dearly , and so did I .	Hence , thou wast thus loved her sister so much as I did love .
Well , we were all born to die .	Well , we were all day to die .
These times of pain are bad times for romance .	These ears of such a small detail proves how much I deserve .
Madam , good night .	Madam , good night .
Give my regards to your daughter .	Give my regards to your lady .
I will .	I will .
Tonight she is shut up in her room , alone with her sadness .	Tonight she is shut up , I am alone with her , gentle Kate .
Sir Paris , I'll make a desperate argument for my child's love .	Sir , she can make a wanton of my own tell .
Tell her about my son Paris's love for her .	Tell her my father , what warlike gentleman have I pity thee .
And tell her , listen to me , on Wednesday , Wait , What day is today ?	And tell her , to thou , whose sake of mine , What , is 't in the town ?
Monday , my lord .	This , my lord .
Monday !	The testament !
Ha , ha !	Ha , ha !
Do you think it's a good idea to rush ?	Do you think you are a good judge ?
We shouldn't have too big a celebration , we can invite a friend or two .	We shall have glory too much upon our house , And we a hundred knights .
Listen , because Tybalt was just killed , people might think that we don't care about his memory as our relative if we have too grand a party .	Hence , thou seest That ever was not so good , That people we care not for his age , if we have been too young and too .
Therefore we'll have about half a dozen friends to the wedding , and that's it .	Therefore we'll have rid of a present , and to the weird sisters , Lie up with it .
What do you think about Thursday ?	What do you think of him ?
My lord , I wish Thursday were tomorrow .	My lord , I wish I were in the field .
Well go on home .	Well go to thy chamber .
Thursday it is , then .	Tedious it is , then .
Are you going ?	Are you not Kent ?
It's still a long time until daybreak .	Tis still a long time toward earth .
That sound you heard was the It was the lark , the bird that sings at dawn , not the nightingale .	That sound did you know That was the boy that feeds the treasons , Not did not , Atone together .
Look , my love , what are those streaks of light in the clouds parting in the east ?	Look , my love , what purpose thou in the streets and feed Of ten thousand crowns in the city of arms ?
Night is over , and day is coming .	Intelligence is dead , and all the day .
That light is not daylight , I know it .	That light methinks is not so well That when I know it .
It's some meteor coming out of the sun to light your way to Mantua .	Tis some strange misprision in the field of gold to greet you .
So stay for a while .	So stay a while for your table .
You don't have to go yet .	You have not spoke to do it .
Let me be captured .	Let me be jocund .
Let me be put to death .	Let me be put to death .
I am content , if that's the way you want it .	I am content , And if the gods take it so .
I want to stay more than I want to go .	I pray you , stay not till I do .
Come , death , and welcome !	Come , death , and welcome !
Let's talk .	Let's talk .
It's not daylight .	Tis not yet .
It is , it is .	It is , it is .
It's the lark that sings so out of tune , making such harsh noise .	Tis the time's plague That about him so full of nature that makes him mad .
Some say the lark makes a sweet division between day and night .	Some say the Earth Was feverous and a thought of all night .
It's not true because she separates us .	Tis not yet true When we are married .
More and more light .	More and more .
More and more pain for us .	More and more than us .
Madam .	Madam .
Nurse ?	Moody ?
Your mother is coming to your bedroom .	Your mother is coming to your mistress .
Day has broken .	This feather stirs .
Then the window lets day in , and life goes out the window .	Then the moon shines in the world , and after the world .
Farewell , farewell !	Farewell , farewell !
Give me one kiss , and I'll go down .	Give me one hand , and I'll go with thee .
He locks himself up alone in his bedroom , shuts his windows to keep out the beautiful daylight , and makes himself an artificial night .	He himself unfold God's Antony , in his books , to run forth And keep his bloody face , And make sure Caesar an honest man .
My noble uncle , do you know why he acts this way ?	My noble uncle , You do you know That he is thus ?
I don't know , and he won't tell me .	I do not , and he shall tell me .
Have you done everything you could to make him tell you the reason ?	Have you done so much to beat him to the answer for you ?
I hope you're lucky enough to hear the true story by sticking around .	I hope thou speak'st To think 'tis true in the same behalf of a man .
Are you gone like that , my love , my lord ?	Are you so hasty that my lord , my love ?
Oh , by this count I'll be many years older before I see my Romeo again .	Oh , by this hand , I have many years since my money shall buy thee .
Farewell !	Farewell !
I won't miss any chance to send my love to you .	I shall devise any time to give you my bond .
Oh , do you think we'll ever meet again ?	O , do you think That wants not this again ?
Oh God , I have a soul that predicts evil things !	Oh God , I have a soul that thou knew'st !
Now that you are down there , you look like someone dead in the bottom of a tomb .	Now that you are there , look you , Antony , look you in the fashion of a sword .
Either my eyesight is failing me , or you look pale .	Either my face is troubled , or look you pale .
And trust me , love , you look pale to me too .	And trust me , love thee , look you , look to me .
Sadness takes away our color .	This feather stirs to our court .
Goodbye , Goodbye !	Adieu , ho !
Oh luck , luck .	Good counsel , good cheer .
Everyone says you can't make up your mind .	Thus doth you make him your full voice .
I hope maybe then you'll send him back home soon .	I hope then I'll never get thee back again .
Who's that calling ?	Who's that ?
Is it my mother ?	Is it my custom ?
What strange reason could she have for coming here ?	What strange times should she have murdered him , for you ?
What's going on , Juliet ?	Wherefore to Dover , sir ?
Madam , I am not well .	Madam , I am not well .
Will you cry about your cousin's death forever ?	Will you not hear your marriage speak of mine ?
Are you trying to wash him out of his grave with tears ?	Are you crept hither to see him of his affection with all the other ?
If you could , you couldn't bring him back to life .	If you could , you shall bring him to this time .
So stop crying .	So stop you .
A little bit of grief shows a lot of love .	A little jot of your country Can not be a note of me .
Let me keep weeping for such a great loss .	Let me keep such a good cheer for a few of your own .
You will feel the loss , but the man you weep for will feel nothing .	You will feel the world , but the dog , you will weep for nothing but a word .
Feeling the loss like this , I can't help but weep for him forever .	Ne'er the white fault , this I can not use but for him , I will die .
Well , girl , you're weeping not for his death as much as for the fact that the villain who killed him is still alive .	Well , Syracusian , look not for his love , But as the soldier that the man is not for his wife , is not Count Benedick .
What villain , madam ?	What villain , madam ?
That villain , Romeo .	That villain , sir .
That's because the murderer is alive .	That's why the king is done .
Yes , madam , he lies beyond my reach .	Ay , madam , he was in my distress .
I wish that no one could avenge my cousin's death except me !	I wish that no one could see my tongue than e'er I felt , scorned , dishonored !
Stop crying .	Impudent strumpet .
I'll send a man to Mantua , where that exiled rogue is living .	I'll send a husband to him , that I am native where you are most knaves .
And then , I hope , you'll be satisfied .	And then , I hope , you be merry .
I'll never be satisfied with Romeo until I see him .	I'll not be satisfied with him until I take thee .
Madam , if you can find a man to deliver the poison , I'll mix it myself so that Romeo will sleep quietly soon after he drinks it .	Madam , if you can find a fool to bring me to the world , I'll prove it so that I will sleep again .
I want to take the love I had for my cousin and take it out on the body of the man who killed him .	I pray you , take the love I bear my cousin for me to take the take of the woman who loves him not .
Find out the way , and I'll find the right man .	Behold the world , I'll find the wound of the man .
But now I have joyful news for you , girl .	But now I have news for you , no more .
And it's good to have joy in such a joyless time .	And therefore 'tis good to have lost joy in such a sight .
Please tell me .	Pray you tell me .
Well , well , you have a careful father , child .	Well , well , you have a little wit , father .
Madam , tell me quickly , what day is that ?	Madam , tell me , what is he that is gone ?
Indeed , my child , at Saint Peter's Church early Thursday morning , the gallant , young , and noble gentleman Count Paris will happily make you a joyful bride .	Indeed , my child , at supper is the morning , Prince , and the young , young , and young , The gods will not make a grandsire of you .
Now , I swear by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too , he will not make me a joyful bride there .	Now , I swear by Apollo, By Apollo , Iago , and he will not make a grandsire of you .
How can I marry him , this husband , before he comes to court me ?	How can I answer , this letter , To hear this man where he comes to fetch him ?
Please , tell my father , madam , I won't marry yet .	Pray you , father , my father , I will marry her .
And , when I do marry , I swear , it will be Romeo , whom you know I hate , rather than Paris .	And , when I do , I swear it will be , whom I protest , I will know thee than rather , than I am .
That's really news !	That's not fair !
Here comes your father .	Here comes your father .
Tell him so yourself , and see how he takes the news .	Tell him so , and leave him not That how to curse .
What are you , girl ?	What are you , sir ?
Some kind of fountain ?	Some kind of fool ?
Why are you still crying ?	Why are you grown hither ?
Have you told her our decision ?	Have you heard her speak with the court ?
I wish the fool were dead and married to her grave !	I wish the fool were dead and to her right tomb !
How can this be ?	How shall this be ?
Isn't she proud of such a match ?	Wast ever tall of my flesh ?
Doesn't she realize how unworthy she is of the gentleman we have found to be her bridegroom ?	Doth she not endure she heaved the owner of this gentleman That we shall be found of her ?
But I am thankful that you have found it .	But I am glad that I have been deceived .
What is this ?	What is this ?
What is this fuzzy logic ?	What is this trick of ?
What is this ?	What is this ?
I hear you say "proud" and "I thank you , " and then "no thank you" and "not proud , " you spoiled little girl .	I hear you say , and I thank God and you , and then for summer , while Stephen Sly , and old man look upon you .
You disgust me , you little bug !	You call me a taper , sir !
You worthless girl !	You worthless man !
You pale face !	You sound !
Shame on you !	Shame on thee !
What , are you crazy ?	What , are you mad ?
Good father , I'm begging you on my knees , be patient and listen to me say just one thing .	Good father , hie thee to my displeasure. , Where thou hast been friends to do not for the play .
Don't say anything .	Fear nothing .
Don't reply .	Make assay .
Don't talk back to me .	Talk not to me .
She disgusts me , the little hussy !	She haunts me the bay of mirth , ho !
God in heaven bless her !	God in heaven forbid it !
My lord , you're wrong to berate her like that .	My lord , thou canst not live to pity her .
And why , wise lady ?	And why , gentle lady ?
Go blabber with your gossiping friends .	Go with your servants , good friends .
I've said nothing wrong .	Thou know'st not die .
Oh , for God's sake .	O , for your beads !
Can't I say something ?	Know I not anything ?
Be quiet , you mumbling fool !	Be quiet , you rogue !
We don't need to hear it .	We need not to fear so .
You're getting too angry .	Thou art armed .
Goddammit !	Slave !
It makes me mad .	It makes me mad .
Day and night , hour after hour , all the time , at work , at play , alone , in company , my top priority has always been to find her a husband .	Faith , and night , fit time , And all the time , at hand , Lie in , not at home , my lord , Both night I have to marry her .
Thursday is coming .	The morn is fair .
Put your hand on your heart and listen to my advice .	Put your eye on thy hand , And stand it still .
If you act like my daughter , I'll marry you to my friend .	If thou didst leave my daughter , I'll marry you , my friend , to my sister .
Think about it .	Think of it .
I won't break this promise .	I shall break this promise .
Delay this marriage for a month , or a week .	Happy this marriage Or with a modest goodness in the seas .
Or , if you don't delay , make my wedding bed in the tomb where Tybalt lies .	Or , if you do , my lord , put forth the field in the field And stay where they will .
Don't talk to me , because I won't say a word .	Talk not to me , but I will not say a word .
Do as you please , because I'm done worrying about you .	Do as you know , And yet what is Pyramus and no matter .
Oh God ! , Oh Nurse , how can this be stopped ?	O God , O thou Arabian deed , how doth this be gone !
My husband is alive on earth , my vows of marriage are in heaven .	My husband is dead on my soul , And all the world in my kingdom days Is after death .
How can I bring those promises back down to earth , unless my husband sends them back down to me by dying and going to heaven ?	How can I find these honors down , To whom my father dies , to walk forth and write to mine ear , The sun and Thisbe be gone to hell ?
Give me comfort .	Give me comfort .
Don't you have one word of joy ?	Dost thou not have one word ?
Give me some comfort , Nurse .	Give me some haste , brother .
Oh , he's a lovely gentleman !	Oh , 'tis a gallant lady !
Romeo's a dishcloth compared to him .	Thou art a soldier to impeach me .
Madam , an eagle does not have eyes as green , as quick , and as fair as the eyes of Paris .	Madam , an arrant knave , as thou hast been , As Edward and beautiful as sweet as the other , The guilty of the world .
Curse my very heart , but I think you should be happy in this second marriage , because it's better than your first .	Curse my heart , but I think , for this man should make thee happy , And yet thy foot-licker .
Even if it's not better , your first marriage is over .	Even if not , your better opinion , I am alone .
Are you speaking from your heart ?	Are you not rated from this ?
Amen !	Amen !
What ?	What ?
Well , you have given me great comfort .	Well , you have given me great .
I made my father angry , so I went to Friar Lawrence's cell to confess and be forgiven .	I made my father so , so I went to the mart , For she is bent to die .
Alright , I will .	Nay , I will .
Oh , that most wicked fiend !	Oh , that foul fiend !
I'm going to the Friar to find out his solution .	It is the morning to the senate house is with you .
If everything else fails , at least I have the power to take my own life .	If something else , after I have lost the power To take my affection to my daughter .
On Thursday , sir ?	On , sir ?
That's very soon .	That's very true .
You say you don't know what the girl thinks .	You say you are not the man who I am .
I don't like it .	I do not like it .
Now you know the reason for the rush .	Now you know the reason for the sake .
Look , sir , here comes the lady walking toward my cell .	Look , sir , here comes the man , my lord , in Athens .
I'm happy to meet you , my lady and my wife .	It is to be done and my leave , Good lady .
That might be the case sir ,	That may be the same , sir .
Good morning , cousin .	Good morrow , brother .
Is it that early in the day ?	Is 't possible that the day shines ?
It's only just now nine o'clock .	Tis not yet but four o'clock .
Was that my father who left here in such a hurry ?	Was my father that here walked in the forest ?
It was .	It was .
I don't have the thing that makes time fly .	I have not heard the time that shines so good .
You're in love ?	Hast thou in love ?
Out .	Out .
Out of love ?	Out of my sight ?
So , where should we eat ?	So , where should we go ?
That "may be" must be , love , on Thursday .	That 'scuse serves me , must be my blame , O youth .
What must be will be .	What must be with him ?
That is a certain truth .	That is a certain thing .
Have you come to make confession to this father ?	Have you not bid me come to this ?
If I answered that question , I'd be making confession to you .	If I shun that , lady , I'll be a knave to him .
Don't deny to him that you love me .	Provoke him that he shall not be .
I'll confess to you that I love him .	I'll warrant you to that I love you .
You will also confess , I'm sure , that you love me .	You will confess , But yet I am not , for you .
If I do so , it will mean more if I say it behind your back than if I say it to your face .	If I do so , it will not be seen it in your sleep , I will say it is to your own advantage .
You poor soul , your face has suffered many tears .	You poor soul , your daughter , hath appointed her .
Your face is mine , and you have slandered it .	Thy face is mine , and you have deserved it .
I have time for you now , my sad daughter .	I have time for you now , my most renowned father .
God forbid that I should prevent sacred devotion !	God forbid that I should be in the field !
Oh , Juliet , I already know about your sad situation .	O , sir , I know not of your daughter's pardon .
I hear that you must marry this count on Thursday , and that nothing can delay it .	I hear that you must marry this acquaintance , and , on that , and nothing can be drunk .
Don't tell me that you've heard about this marriage , Friar , unless you can tell me how to prevent it .	Make me not known that thou hast seen me , this country doth not greatly care to hear of it , how it is .
If you who are so wise can't help , please be kind enough to call my solution wise .	If you are so , my dear friend , You may be glad to see my Thisbe's tale needs not my heart .
Hold on , then .	Hold , then be done .
Tomorrow is Wednesday .	Tomorrow is the day .
Tomorrow night make sure that you are alone .	Tomorrow night make you sure , Monsieur Jaques .
Don't let the Nurse stay with you in your bedroom .	Make the ambassadors not stay with me in your distrust .
Give me the vial .	Give me the cups .
Give it to me !	Give it to me !
Love will give me strength , and strength will help me accomplish this plan .	Love will give me audience , and take this bond To help me from this bond .
Goodbye , dear Father .	Adieu , good madam .
You won't get any bad cooks from me .	You shall be little from any of my good lord .
How can you test them like that ?	How wilt thou hunt upon thee ?
So the cooks who can't lick their fingers aren't hired .	So the maiden follows that if they shook their heads .
Go , get out of here .	Go , get thee gone .
We're unprepared for this wedding celebration .	Set me for his own old man .
Yes , that's true .	Nay , that's true .
Look , she's come home from confession with a happy look on her face .	Look , here's my troth , come from me with a happy tale .
Holy Father Lawrence instructed me to fall on my knees and beg your forgiveness .	Father 's , bear me to my chamber and hang thee on your behalf .
Send for the Count .	Send for the slave .
Go tell him about this .	Go you to him again .
I'll make this wedding happen tomorrow morning .	I'll make this wood salesman and enter .
I met the young man at Lawrence's cell .	I met the man at your daughter's debt .
Well , I'm glad about this .	Well , 'tis not so .
This is good .	This is good .
Stand up .	Stand up .
Yes , alright , go , I say , and bring him here .	Ay , go , Emilia , I say , and bring him here .
Now , before God , our whole city owes this friar a great debt .	Now , before our last , God defend our nature in such a great manner of life .
Nurse , will you come with me to my closet and help me pick out the clothes and the jewelry I'll need to wear tomorrow ?	Niece , will you come with me to my house and tell me the truth of mine own hand and I'll be able to yield the message ?
No , not until Thursday .	No , not till then .
There's plenty of time .	There's two of us .
We'll have the wedding at the church tomorrow .	We'll have the tongs and the bones of France .
It's already almost night .	Tis already blown down .
And everything will be alright , I promise you , wife .	And will it be till I will , my love , thy love .
You should go to Juliet and dress her up .	You should to go and fetch her to my tent .
I'm not going to bed tonight .	It is not meet me well .
Leave me alone .	Leave me alone .
I'll pretend to be the housewife for once .	I'll to the throng to be so .
Yes , those are the best clothes .	Ay , these are the best men .
What , are you busy ?	What , are you sleepy ?
Do you need my help ?	Do you not need my help ?
I'm sure you have your hands full preparing for the sudden festivities .	It is your words that all these sorrows have I forgot , it is .
Good night .	Good night .
Only God knows when we'll meet again .	Only God knows that he shall meet again .
In my desperate situation , I have to act alone .	In my mind's eye , I have not spoke to act .
Alright , here's the vial .	Ho , thou liest .
What if this mixture doesn't work at all ?	What if thou wert not this in peril ?
Will I be married tomorrow morning ?	Will I be married tomorrow ?
Lie down right there .	Lie but down there .
Oh , look !	Oh , look !
I think I see my cousin Tybalt's ghost .	I think I see my cousin was a fool .
Wait , Tybalt , wait !	Hark , hark !
Romeo , Romeo , Romeo !	Down , thou , conclude !
Here's a drink .	Here's a word .
I drink to you .	I drink to you .
No , cousin , I'm crying .	No , cousin , no .
Good man , why are you crying ?	Good man , how dost thou lions ?
Yes , this is what love does .	Nay , this is what I love .
What else is love ?	What else is false ?
It's a sweet lozenge that you choke on .	Tis a sweet father that hates you .
Goodbye , cousin .	Adieu , good madam .
Wait .	Hark .
I'll come with you .	I'll come with thee .
If you leave me like this , you're doing me wrong .	If you will leave me not , this man is well .
I'm not myself .	It is not possible .
I'm not here .	It is not day .
Tell me seriously , who is the one you love ?	Tell me , thou hast but the eyes of love ?
You mean I should groan and tell you ?	You mean I should be and tempted of your heart ?
Groan ?	Committed ?
No .	No .
But tell me seriously who it is .	But tell me it is not necessity .
Take these keys and get more spices , Nurse .	Take these two days and more , boy , thou hast no more .
They're calling for dates and quinces in the pastry kitchen .	Thou hotly lust'st to be damned in the bosom .
Come on , wake up , wake up , wake up !	Come , come , wake up , Ariel ! ,
The second cock crowed .	The second noise he's going .
The curfew-bell rang .	The cockerel .
Don't worry about the cost .	Trust not Trebonius , I have .
Go , you old housewife , go .	Go , you old mole , go .
Go to bed , dear .	Go to , dear sister .
You'll be sick tomorrow because you've stayed up all night .	You'll be sick tomorrow Or , to be revenged on thee .
I've stayed up all night many times before for less important matters , and I've never gotten sick .	Thou shalt be years in all night , Lest that I am almost savage , and yet I am not sick .
Yes , you've been a ladies ' man in your time .	Nay , thou hast been a little more , Lest by your time .
A jealous woman , a jealous woman !	A jealous woman , a mad !
Now , fellow , what have you got there ?	Now , fellow , what have you left there ?
Hurry up , hurry up .	Up , good friends , away .
I'm smart enough to find the logs myself without bothering Peter .	It is too cold to buy the ducats And rather to weigh the mighty sender .
Right , and well said .	Right , and well said .
That guy's funny .	That Lodovico is wise .
Goodness , it's daylight .	Well , 'tis day .
Wife !	Hark !
What ?	What ?
Hey , Nurse !	Sound , trumpet !
Go wake Juliet .	Go fetch thyself .
Go and get her dressed .	Go and importune her .
I'll go and chat with Paris .	I'll go and bind him with you .
Hey , hurry up , hurry up !	Ho , stand up to my stand !
The bridegroom is already here .	The duke is here at us .
Hurry up , I say .	Up , I say , again .
Mistress !	Mistress !
Hey , mistress !	Avaunt , my slave !
I bet she's fast asleep .	I am Christophero Sly .
Hey , lady !	Hark , lady !
Hey , love , I say !	Arise , I say , my lord !
Madam !	Madam !
Sweetheart !	Hark !
Hey , bride !	Companion , hence !
What , you don't say a word ?	What , you say a word ?
You take your beauty sleep now .	You take your life now , sir .
How sound asleep she is !	How oddly he is suited !
Yes , let the count take you in your bed .	Nay , let the duke take of you in your bed .
He'll wake you up , I bet .	He'll wake you up , my lord .
Won't he ?	Wilt thou ?
What's all the noise in here ?	What's the matter in here ?
Oh , sad day !	O sad day !
What is the matter ?	What is the matter ?
Look , look !	Lo , sir !
Oh , what a sad day !	Oh , what a sad day !
Oh my , Oh my !	Oh , my lord , Cassio !
My child , my reason for living , wake up , look up , or I'll die with you !	My child , my reason for my master's answer , Or look you up of the devil , I'll fight for thee !
For shame , bring Juliet out here .	For shame , give out here hence .
Her bridegroom is here .	Her name is Gloucester .
She's dead , deceased , she's dead .	She's dead , And foul is dead .
Curse the day !	Strike the day !
Curse the day !	Strike the day !
She's dead , she's dead , she's dead !	She's dead , And she's dead too !
No !	No !
Let me see her .	Let me see her .
Oh no !	O no !
She's cold .	She's desperate .
Her blood has stopped , and her joints are stiff .	Her blood hath fierce , and her powers are bound .
She's been dead for some time .	She's dead for some other way .
She's dead , like a beautiful flower , killed by an unseasonable frost .	She's dead , And like a mad tale , by her own beloved .
Oh , sad day !	O sad day !
Oh , this is a painful time !	Oh , this is a day !
Death , which has taken her away to make me cry , now ties up my tongue and won't let me speak .	Death , whose best qualities has her honors do have seen me , And now I'll never yield to my fortunes , and let me speak .
Come , is the bride ready to go to church ?	Come , is the duke that minister to him ?
She's ready to go , but she'll never return .	She's gone to fear , but I will leave him .
Death is my son-in-law .	Death is my prisoner .
Death is my heir .	Death is my office .
My daughter married death .	My daughter hath killed me .
I will die and leave Death everything .	I will die and die , and thou shalt leave me .
Life , wealth , everything belongs to Death .	Happy , tide , and everything must be .
Have I waited so long to see this morning , only to see this ?	Have I not offended so long , To see this day to see the world ?
Accursed , unhappy , wretched , hateful day !	Hard , hard. , O filthy traitor !
This is the most miserable hour of all time !	This is the most unkindest cut of all !
I had only one child , one poor child , one poor and loving child , the one thing I had to rejoice and comfort myself , and cruel Death has stolen it from me !	I had only one child , one child , one child , and the poor one , and I had to leave , The more my sons and Clarence got it from me !
Oh pain !	O vengeance !
Oh painful , painful , painful day !	O blessed world , O thy soul !
There has never been so black a day as today .	There hath never been such a man as e'er my lord .
Oh painful day , Oh painful day !	O day untowardly turned , great a day !
She was tricked , divorced , wronged , spited , killed !	She was not slain , sir , false , O , woman !
Cruel , cruel Death killed her .	Say , cruel , not I saw her .
Oh love !	O love !
Oh life !	O life !
There is no life , but my love is dead !	There is no love but my life , my love !
Despised , distressed , hated , martyred , killed !	Hard , hard. , O filthy traitor !
Why did this have to happen now ?	Why did this have been to me ?
My soul and not my child !	My soul and soul not my child !
You are dead !	You are dead !
Be quiet , for shame !	Be quiet , for shame !
The cure for confusion is not yelling and screaming .	The cure you for that is not down , but you can not choose .
You had this child with the help of heaven .	You had this division betwixt the duke of England .
Now heaven has her .	Now heaven have mercy .
She is in a better place .	She is in a better place .
You could not prevent her from dying someday , but heaven will give her eternal life .	You could not conjure up her , yet I will ne'er shame myself , and therefore will not give it .
The most you hope for was for her to marry wealthy and rise up the social ladder , that was your idea of heaven .	The most you should know for mine to pray for her wealth and the gentle rain , whose mere madness Was wrong in thy thought .
And now you cry , even though she has risen up above the clouds , as high as heaven itself ?	And now you cry , By the Holy Rood , That she hath turned the heavy sea , as formidable as the earth !
Oh , in this love , you love your child so badly , that you go mad , even though she is in heaven .	O , in this love , you love your love , That you , that you shall think , is not thus long .
It is best to marry well and die young , better than to be married for a long time .	It is to be honest and honorable , And yet to better , for ransom shall be long to be married .
Our wedding banquet will become a sad burial feast .	Our castle will be a stranger and hath endured , great music .
Our celebratory hymns will change to sad funeral marches .	Our worser business Makes our approaches to great traffic .
Everyone prepare to take this beautiful corpse to her grave .	Thus have I to fill this great pocket of a new Gorgon .
Don't disturb the heavens any more by trying to go against heaven's will .	Hear the shrill whistle , which will never be seen So in these sorrows I am not guilty .
Well , we can put away our pipes and go home .	Well , we can put up our hands and go to bed .
Yes , well , things could get better .	Ay , well , things could be better .
No , not a sad song .	No , not a whit .
It's not the right time to play .	Tis not the right time to play .
You won't , then ?	You shall , then ?
No .	No .
Then I'll really give it to you .	Then I'll not give it to you .
What will you give us ?	What will you give us ?
No money , I swear .	No money , I warrant thee .
I'll call you a minstrel .	I'll call you a sermon .
Then I'll call you a serving-creature .	Then I'll call you a present .
Then I'll smack you on the head with the serving-creature's knife .	Then I'll salute you with the blackest head of the mouth .
I'll make you sing .	I'll make thee chide .
Do you hear me ?	Do you not hear me ?
Answer me like men .	Answer me but one .
Well , sir , because silver has a sweet sound .	Well , sir , that makes a poor sound .
Another studpid answer !	Another answer , sir !
What do you say , James Well , I don't know what to say .	What do you say , Captain Macmorris , I have to say , what is it .
I'll answer for you .	I'll answer for you .
It is "music with her silver sound , " because musicians have no gold to use to make sounds .	It is with her modest word , Which , and no doubt To use no indirect or lawless feather from
What an annoying man , this guy is !	What an arrant knave , this is a disaster !
Forget about him , Jack !	Arrest him , thou officer !
If I can trust my dreams , then some joyful news is coming soon .	If I can tell my dreams , then some ill news will be gone again .
Oh my !	Oh , my lord !
How sweet it would be to actually have the woman I love , when merely thinking about love makes me so happy .	How long would it be the Moor to love the woman , That ever I did love thee so much from the love .
Do you have news from Verona ! , What is it , Balthasar ?	Do you have news from me , Signior ? , What is it , sir ?
Do you bring me a letter from the friar ?	Do you bring me a letter from the Jew ?
How is my wife ?	How fares my wife ?
Is my father well ?	Is my father well ?
How is my Juliet ?	How fares my lord ?
I ask that again because nothing can be wrong if she is well .	I ask that patience again , that she may be well , if she is well .
Then she is well , and nothing is wrong .	Then she is wise , and nothing well , man .
Her body sleeps in the Capulet tomb , and her immortal soul lives with the angels in heaven .	Her body sleeps , and the foul stars , in heaven and boot , the foul error hath in her eyes .
I saw her buried in her family's tomb , and then I came here to tell you the news .	I saw her in the monument of her womb , And then I here attend you here .
Oh , pardon me for bringing this bad news , but you told me it was my job , sir .	O , pardon me for this much chain , but you have told me , my lord , it was .
You wouldn't tell a sick man he "seriously" has to make his will , it would just make him worse .	You would not know a man a man to his own , he would make him make it worse .
Seriously , cousin , I love a woman .	Sooth , O love , I love thee not .
Then you were right on target .	Then you were right on thy side .
The woman I love is beautiful .	The woman I love is beautiful .
A beautiful target is the one that gets hit the fastest .	A fair one is the lesser than that the knave of a treaty .
Well , you're not on target there .	Well , thou dost not be thy wit .
Yes she has , and by keeping celibate , she wastes her beauty .	Yes , she hath laid by herself , and she herself hath deceived .
She's too beautiful and too wise to deserve heaven's blessing by making me despair .	She's too fair and too gentle to be praised by your Highness To me by such a fool .
Take my advice .	Take my advice .
Don't think about her .	Make it not known .
Teach me to forget to think !	Teach me to fear my fall !
Is it really true ?	Is 't not true ?
Then I rebel against you , stars !	Then I pronounced heaven , strike you dead !
You know where I live .	You know where I will tarry .
Get me some ink and paper , and hire some horses to ride .	Get me some ink and paper , some scurvy will have scope .
I will leave here for Verona tonight .	I will leave here for the jest .
Please , sir , have patience .	Pray you , sir , take patience .
You look pale and wild as if you're going to hurt yourself .	You look pale and pale , as if thou inclined to kill yourself .
Tsk , you're wrong .	Minion , thou liest .
Leave me and do what I told you to do .	Leave me and tell me what I have to do .
Don't you have a letter for me from the friar ?	Dost thou not suspect a wrong for me , the handle ?
No , my good lord .	No , my good lord .
No matter .	No matter .
Get on your way and hire those horses .	Get thee upon thy hand And make her wander we .
I'll be with you right away .	I'll be with thee betimes .
Well , Juliet , I'll lie with you tonight .	Well , bawd I'll go with you again .
Let's see how .	Let's see how .
Destructive thoughts come quickly to the minds of desperate men !	Thy thoughts hence together , and the holy rites of men !
As I remember , this should be the house .	As I should , this should be the fool .
Today's a holiday , so the beggar's shop is shut .	Y'are a baggage , the adder is so too .
Hey !	Hark !
Pharmacist !	Hoo !
Who's that calling so loud ?	Who's that calls upon you ?
Come here , man .	Come hither , man .
I see that you are poor .	I see that you are not sad .
Here are forty ducats .	Here are a hundred marks .
You're this poor and wretched and still afraid to die ?	Was this most monstrous and peevish lords , shall they not die ?
Your cheeks are thin because of hunger .	Your cheeks are most tall , sir .
I can see in your eyes that you're starving .	I can not see your breath upon the instant .
The world is not your friend , and neither is the law .	The world is not your name , and yet is no note .
The world doesn't make laws to make you rich .	The world shall make thee most known to our ends .
I pay you because you're poor , not because you want me to buy this .	I pay thee , thou young man , That thou shalt not find thy part .
Holy Franciscan Friar !	O Isis !
Brother , hey !	Brother , hark !
That sounds like the voice of Friar John .	That sounds like the melancholy Lord of Caesar .
Welcome back from Mantua .	Welcome back to Rome .
What does Romeo say ?	What sayest thou now ?
Or , if he wrote down his thoughts , give me his letter .	Or , if he stay still , his daughter took his offer .
I couldn't go to Mantua because I was stuck there .	I shall not go unrewarded ere I come down to 't .
Then who took my letter to Romeo ?	Then hath my daughter to her ?
Unhappy fortune !	Poor fortune !
Brother , I'll go and bring it to you .	Brother , I'll go to 't And bring it to you .
Now I must go to the tomb alone .	Now must I go to the devil's turn .
Within three hours Juliet will wake up .	Within three hours will be thankful and merrily .
But I'll write again to Mantua , and I'll keep her in my cell until Romeo comes .	But I'll write to thee again , I'll keep her in my mouth till he comes to hell .
She's shut inside a dead man's tomb !	She's turned upon a gentle cheek , A dear Queen !
Give me your torch , boy .	Give me thy hand , boy .
Go away and stay apart from me .	Go away and stay from me .
Put the torch out , so I can't be seen .	Put out the light , I think not of him .
Give me those flowers .	Give me some water .
Do as I tell you .	Do as I bid you .
Go .	Go .
The boy is warning me that someone approaches .	The boy is making me study of that .
Who's ruining my rituals of true love ?	Comes my deserts and all my love ?
It's someone with a torch !	Tis with a demi-cannon to say !
I must hide in the darkness for awhile .	I must hide in the arbor and see for mercy .
Give me that pickax and the crowbar .	Give me that the bell and I'll do .
I'll go , sir , and I won't bother you .	I'll go , sir , and I shall follow you .
That's the way to show me friendship .	That's the way to show these friendship .
Take this .	Take this .
Good and noble young man , don't mess with someone who's desperate .	Good and noble judge , But thou didst kill me with thy gentle eyes .
Get away from here and leave me .	Get thee hence and take me here .
Think about the ones who have died .	Think of the world , sir .
Let them put fear in your heart .	Let them be in your heart .
Please , young man , don't make me angry .	Pray you , old man , make me not haunt me mad .
Oh , go away !	Oh , go away !
Don't stay here , go away .	Bear it away , Caesar .
Live , and from now on , say a madman mercifully told you to run away .	Live , and now , from now , a mad beggar , I told thee not to run away .
I'm arresting you as a criminal .	It is a monster as a maid .
Are you going to provoke me ?	Are you not spoken to this ?
Alright , let's fight , boy !	Ho , let's be done !
Oh Lord , they're fighting !	O Lord , what fools are !
I'll go call the watch .	I'll go see the throng .
Alright , I will .	Nay , I will .
It's Mercutio's relative , noble Count Paris !	Tis noble own. , You , master !
What did my man say ?	What did my man say ?
I think he told me Paris was about to marry Juliet .	I think he was not told me of her to Antony .
Isn't that what he said ?	Art thou indeed , man ?
Or was I dreaming ?	Or was I dreaming ?
I'll bury you in a magnificent grave .	I'll meet you in a sober eye .
A grave ?	A hundred then ?
Oh no !	O no !
Juliet lies here , and her beauty fills this tomb with light .	He lies here , and her father's dead In heaven with those that light .
Death has sucked the honey from your breath , but it has not yet ruined your beauty .	Death hath the primal eldest wit of this war , And yet it hath not lost your age .
You haven't been conquered .	You have been nobly .
Oh , what better favor can I do for you than to kill the man who killed you with the same hand that made you die young .	Oh , what a favor I can do for you , To find the man you did know That with the eye that will make thee laugh but a little .
Should I believe that death is in love with you , and that the awful monster keeps you here to be his mistress ?	Shall I believe that in death , And with a valiant flea that calls them to you , That you must be his mistress to a holiday ?
Here , here I'll remain with worms that are your chamber-maids .	Here , here comes with us , for your city's senses .
Oh , I'll rest here forever .	Oh , I'll rest you forever .
Eyes , look out for the last time !	Eyes , look upon the time !
Arms , make your last embrace !	Sirrah , your curse of all !
His drugs work quickly .	His wits seek no night .
So I die with a kiss .	So I with him and no .
Look at other beautiful girls .	Look at thy face , noble Portia .
Saint Francis , help me !	Saint Valentine , a soldier !
How often tonight have my old feet stumbled on gravestones !	How now , my pretty little woman in her scolding hand !
I'm a friend , a friend who knows you well .	It is a friend , A friend who knows you .
God bless you !	God bless thee !
Tell me , my good friend , what is that light over there ?	Tell me , good friend , what is the name of heaven and gone ?
It looks to me like it's burning in the Capulet tomb .	It looks like me to be under the seas and keep our party .
Who is it ?	Who is 't ?
Romeo .	Heigh-ho .
How long has he been there ?	How long hath he been thus ?
For a full half hour .	For a full year to the king .
Go with me to the tomb .	Go with me to the duchess .
I don't dare , sir .	I dare not , sir .
Stay , then .	Stay , then .
I'll go alone .	I'll go alone .
I'm suddenly afraid .	It is impossible .
Oh , I'm very scared something awful has happened .	Oh , 'tis very much of a gentleman ! " .
As I slept under this yew-tree here , I had a dream that my master and someone else were fighting and that my master killed him .	As I slept here at this hour , I had a dream that would find my Thisbe's face and my husband Were not my breath within this day .
What is this blood that stains the stony entrance of this tomb ?	What is this passion that the gentle duke of England shall marry you ?
Oh friendly friar !	O soft !
Where is my husband ?	Where is my husband ?
I remember very well where I should be , and here I am .	I remember very well , But I should be here , and I am here .
Where is my Romeo ?	Where is my wife ?
I hear some noise .	I hear some cry .
Lady , come out of the tomb .	Lady , come , thou hast aboard the church .
A greater power than we can fight has ruined our plan .	A greater gift than the power shall be wrought , Your majesty .
Come , come away .	Come , come away .
Your husband lies dead there , and Paris too .	Thy husband dead , and he have gone .
Come , I'll place you among the sisterhood of holy nuns .	Come , I'll place you with the next street of mine own .
It's a cup , closed in my true love's hand ?	Tis a villain , And in my husband's voice ?
Poison , I see , has been the cause of his death .	Thus , I have , The first part of his followers .
I will kiss your lips .	I will kiss your lips .
Perhaps there's still some poison on them , to make me die with a medicinal kiss .	Yet there's no power to make them come , I will make thee fly with me .
Oh , noise ?	What , man ?
Then I'll be quick .	Then I'll be bloody .
Oh , good , a knife !	O , good a night !
Rust inside my body and let me die .	Thou makest me rose and my lord .
This is the place .	This is the place .
There , where the torch is burning .	There , where the day is mad .
The ground is bloody .	The ground is most prepared .
This is a pitiful sight !	This is a sleepy sight !
Go , tell the Prince .	Go , tell the truth .
Run to the Capulets .	Run to the tyrant .
Wake up the Montagues .	Wake up the truth .
Have some others search .	Have some men run .
Here's Romeo's man .	Here's a man .
We found him in the churchyard .	We found him in the closet .
Hold him in custody until the Prince gets here .	Hold him in the place , and let the Christian work .
Here is a friar who's trembling , sighing and weeping .	Here is a rural fellow That is not born of smooth behavior .
We took this pickax and this shovel from him , as he was walking from this side of the graveyard .	We took this sacred burial and , as thou wast , That looked from this most pregnant and mighty power , He is not yet past .
Very suspicious .	Very well .
Hold the friar too .	Hold the face too .
What crimes happen so early in the morning that I have to wake up before the usual time ?	What crimes did you come so near the town That we have sent for us to be the king ?
What's the problem , that they cry out so loud ?	What's the difference , " that they cry out ?
Some people in the street are crying "Romeo." Some are crying "Juliet , " and some are crying "Paris." They're all running in an open riot toward our tomb .	Some people in the morning are princes , two and seven thousand , Makes all the night five hundred and twenty thousand of all their wills , Bequeathing it as a common man .
Investigate how this foul murder came about .	Behold how this foul world is .
Oh heavens !	O heavens !
Oh wife , look at how our daughter bleeds !	O wife , how long and thy precedent are our own !
That knife should be in its sheath on that Montague's back , but instead it's mis-sheathed in my daughter's breast .	That should be in an onion that would be in debt , but that by nature hath not a thunderbolt .
Oh my !	Oh , my lord !
This sight of death is like a bell that warns me I'm old and I'll die soon .	This sight of death is like a lover's one , And that the most strong youth of thine shall make .
Oh , my liege , my wife died tonight .	O my lord , This news that killed me .
Sadness over my son's exile stopped her breath .	Tonight is eloquent on my behalf to her .
What further pain must I endure in my old age ?	What further shall I be in my conscience yet ?
Look , and you'll see .	Look , and see you .
And then I'll be the leader of pain , and maybe I'll lead you as far as death .	And then I'll be the gift of prophecy , lest I , till to set thee as a free show .
In the meantime , hold on , and be patient .	In the meantime , hold it up awhile .
I am the greatest , but I was able to do the least .	I am the greatest man , but I did not till I did the matter .
I have already condemned and excused myself .	I have already been seen and yet of Pompey .
Tell us what you know about this affair .	Tell us what you think of this .
I will be brief because I'm not going to live long enough to tell a boring story .	I will be brief , though I am not mad to be a woman , but to be so weary .
In the meantime I wrote to Romeo and told him to come here on this awful night to help remove her from her temporary grave when the sleeping potion wore off .	In the meantime I yield to cope myself , Who now went to work on 's , to be here from her , and the place to th ' chins and yet her empire lies .
I know all of this .	I know none of this .
I brought my master news of Juliet's death .	I brought my master the news of Rome .
Give me the letter .	Give me the letter .
Oh , brother Montague , give me your hand .	O , brother , give me thy hand .
But what do you say to my request ?	But what do you say to my request ?
I can only repeat what I've said before .	I can not think that what hath chanced .
My daughter is still very young .	My daughter is still his own .
She's not even fourteen years old .	She's not even but thy idle cause .
Girls younger than she often marry and become happy mothers .	Bettering sovereignty , That would be false with her .
Girls who marry so young grow up too soon .	Fathers that Do seem so dear a loss of all your tribe .
But go ahead and charm her , gentle Paris ; make her love you .	But go you and importune her speak , And make her free of mine own eyes .
Tonight I'm having a feast that we've celebrated for many years .	Tonight is a month that we shall have years for many .
At my humble house tonight , you can expect to see dazzling stars that walk on the ground and light the sky from below .	At my house today , and there shall be ruled by the earth , that the earth and the stars drop on our ground , And all the foul stars and blood Are past .
In the beautiful city of Verona , where our story takes place , a long-standing hatred between two families erupts into new violence , and citizens stain their hands with the blood of their fellow citizens .	In the morn By 'r Lady , what our crosses does carry forth a new petticoat , and then their hearts are at the king's house , And they with all the petty rites of their kingdom .
Two unlucky children of these enemy families become lovers and commit suicide .	Two children of their children are appointed The most healthful to my hands .
Their unfortunate deaths put an end to their parents ' feud .	Their defeat of their estate unto a great end , ere morning .
Come along with me .	Come along with me .
Find the people whose names are on this list ?	Behold the golden laws of your royal highness ?
It is written that shoemakers and tailors should play with each others ' tools , that fisherman should play with paints , and painters should play with with fishing nets .	It is that great form and countries discord must with some other should be , That therewithal the wretches that should play with deformed head , You will not play with us .
But I've been sent to find the people whose names are written on this list , and I can't read !	But thou hast been The subject of whose business to laugh , The profit I am , not on the end !
But here come some people , right in the nick of time .	But here come some of us , sister by the which you have .
For when you cut your shin .	For when you have seen your money .
What ?	What ?
Romeo , are you crazy ?	What , are you mad ?
I'm locked up in a prison and deprived of food .	It is locked up and come to a stake .
I'm whipped and tortured , May God give you a good evening .	It is a gentleman , and I will give you a good education .
Excuse me , sir , do you know how to read ?	Dismiss me , sir , do you know how to th ' eye ?
I can read my own fortune in my misery .	I can not hide my former sharpness ill times .
Perhaps you've learned from life and not from books .	Yet thou hast seen me and thy gentle mistress .
But please tell me , can you read anything you see ?	But please you tell me , shall you see the work ?
Yes , if I know the language and the letters .	Ay , if I know the truth and my letters .
I see .	I see .
Well , that's an Stay , fellow .	Well , that's an oath , sir .
I can read .	I can not .
Signor Martino and his wife and daughters , Count Anselme and his beautiful sisters , Vitruvio's widow , Signor Placentio and his lovely nieces , Mercutio and his brother Valentine , My uncle Capulet and his wife and daughters , My fair niece Rosaline and Livia ,	Signor Antonio and his wife , Thy husband and his noble mistress , The quaint , virtuous , virtuous and virtuous , reverend persuasion , his uncle , and his uncle York , My sole , and virtuous and virtuous , My moods and his displeasures and his indignations , and virtuous and virtuous .
Signor Valentio and his cousin Tybalt , Lucio and the lively Helena." That's a nice group of people .	Signor Bassanio and his noble husband , Profaned , dishonored , and the third of the world is true .
Where are they supposed to come ?	Where are they running away ?
Up .	Up .
Where ?	Where ?
To supper ?	To supper ?
To our house .	To our house .
Whose house ?	Whose house ?
My master's house .	My master's mind .
Indeed , I should have asked you before who he was .	Indeed , I should have known you where he was born .
Now I'll tell you so you don't have to ask .	Now I'll tell you so , a province shall have .
My master is the great and rich Capulet , and if you don't belong to the house of Montague , please come and drink a cup of wine .	My master is most worthy , and all the world , if I could not take the message of Father , I will come to the word of a soldier .
Have a nice day !	Have a good night !
The beautiful Rosaline whom you love so much will be at Capulet's traditional feast , along with every beautiful woman in Verona .	The honest Lord Hastings hath so much of you will be at odds , To home with fair virgins ' white .
Go there and compare her objectively to some other girls I'll show you .	Go there and importune her witness That she makes false show of thee .
A woman more beautiful than the one I love ?	A woman no more than the one I know of ?
The sun itself has never seen anyone as beautiful since the world began .	The sun itself hath not so gross As doth the fashion of the devil .
I'll go with you .	I'll go with you .
Nurse , where's my daughter ?	Upon my eye , Signor Benedick ?
Tell her to come to me .	Tell her to come to bed .
I swear to you by my virginity at age twelve , I already told her to come .	I swear to you by my daughter's salute at the marketplace , I found her uncle Gloucester .
Come on !	Come on !
Who's calling me ?	Coldhearted toward me ?
Your mother .	Your mother .
Madam , I'm here .	Madam , here comes .
What do you want ?	What do you here ?
You know how young my daughter is .	You know how young my daughter is .
Yes , I know her age down to the hour .	Ay , I know her is the sun to strike there .
She's not even fourteen .	She's not so well .
I'd bet fourteen of my own teeth , but , I'm sorry to say , I only have four teeth , she's not fourteen .	I'd rather bear my life of thee , For I am almost honest , but I have not , I have not years , being not slain .
Whether it's even or odd , of all the days in the year , on the night of Lammas Eve , she'll be fourteen .	Whether thou art ; or more of worldly world , The precious scurvy spot of Lord Buckingham , To be thy grieved son , And , being within , thou diest .
She and Susan , God rest her and all Christian souls , were born on the same day .	She and her queen , and her slave , And souls the murderer ' most fell ' hand , Which looked for .
Well , Susan died and is with God .	Well , all's that , and after that .
She was too good for me .	She was too good for me .
But like I said , on the night of Lammas Eve , she will be fourteen .	But like I said , on the end of the night , I will be saved .
Yes , she will .	Nay , she will not .
Indeed , I remember it well .	Indeed , I remember it .
It's been eleven years since the earthquake .	Tis nine o'clock in the forest .
I had put bitter wormwood on my breast as I was sitting in the sun , under the wall of the dovehouse .	I had put my rackets to my mistress As I was born on the moon , A blessed day , which falls out of madness .
But like I said , when she tasted the bitter wormwood on my nipple , the pretty little babe got irritated and started to quarrel with my breast .	But like I said she was the most scurvy fool That laid the value of my sex , made my little tongue to sleep with my bare brow .
Then the dovehouse shook with the earthquake .	Then the bowl were embossed And woe the whole world .
There was no need to tell me to get out of there .	There was no need to tell me what to do there .
Oh , " he said , "Did you fall on your face ?	Oh , he said , That many times of your death Is going to your chapel ?
You'll Enough of this .	Twill be done .
Please be quiet .	Prithee , peace .
Yes , madam .	Ay , madam .
But I can't help laughing to think that the baby stopped crying and said , "Yes." I swear , she had a bump on her forehead as big as a rooster's testicle .	But I dare not drink to cry , But the devil that strikes , and I said she had a kiss , As she hath proved herself as a casing air .
It was a painful bruise , and she was crying bitterly .	It was a branch and parcel of mine eye , Which was the model .
Yes , " said my husband , "Did you fall on your face ?	Ay , said , " quoth he , my lord , upon your court ?
You'll fall backward when you grow up , won't you , Jule ? " And she stopped crying and said , "Yes." Now you stop too , Nurse , please .	You'll fall As thus you grow , And when you shall catch , 'Twere then , she married , And so , too , you may , sir , and your vow .
May God choose you to receive his grace .	May God grant you he loves his other .
You were the prettiest baby I ever nursed .	You were the slave That ever holds me .
If I live to see you get married someday , all my wishes will come true .	If I live to see you , you will be married , all my people will come again .
Tell me , my daughter Juliet , what is your attitude about getting married ?	Tell me , my lord , what is your fellow of his estate to be married ?
It is an honor that I do not dream of .	It is an excellent action , I doubt not of it .
Well , start thinking about marriage now .	Well , all's one else , your highness .
Here in Verona there are girls younger than you , girls from noble families , who have already become mothers .	Here in Sardis there are mortal men , And from the noble wars of those those whom I have lived .
By my count , I was already your mother at just about your age , while you remain a virgin .	By my troth , I was your mother , at your time , And now you may be a man to your younger daughter .
Well then , I'll say this quickly : the valiant Paris wants you as his bride .	Well then , I'll say this : Desdemona is the very verge Of his confine .
What a man , young lady .	What a man , honest .
Summertime in Verona has no flower as fine as him .	Haply in sow's matters hath not appeared , nor he hath not .
Lose nothing ?	Cicero nothing ?
I'll look at him and try to like him , at least if what I see is likable .	I'll look at him and presently at least , nor I am glad to see him , for I am sure .
But I won't let myself fall for him any more than your permission allows .	But I shall never find thee again , If no more work for your Majesty .
Everything's out of control .	Most like a whale .
Please , follow straight after me .	Pray you , follow me .
We'll follow you .	We'll follow you .
Go , girl , look for a man who'll give you happy nights at the end of happy days .	Go , sirrah , look to a man for a little piece of work for the next days .
What will we say is our excuse for being here ?	What will we say , our honored for his ransom ?
Or should we enter without apologizing ?	Or should we enter with your Lordship ?
It's out of fashion to give lengthy explanations like that .	Tis out of fashion to give , Which of him .
Let them judge us however they please .	Let us bear 't , for we sake .
Give me a torch .	Give me a calendar .
I don't want to dance .	I pray you , sir .
No , noble Romeo , you've got to dance .	No , noble duke , We have to drink .
Not me , believe me .	Not me , believe me .
You're wearing dancing shoes with nimble soles .	Thou art sensible with fear , small regard .
My soul is made out of lead , and it's so heavy it keeps me stuck on the ground so I can't move .	My soul is full of doubt , and thou art so bought a bear of it and borne me so That I may not be so .
You're a lover .	Thou art a soldier .
Take Cupid's wings and fly higher than the average man .	Take heed and th ' selfsame work looks on the charge .
His arrow has pierced me too deeply , so I can't fly high with his cheerful feathers .	His excellence hath flown me , but I may not fly so bitter to him ; I am not treacherous .
I sink under the heavy weight of love .	I ' th ' mire , and this is dear .
We won't take their garbage .	We shall ne'er be younger .
I hit hard when I'm angry .	I am glad by your mad tale .
Angry enough to run away .	There's enough to be done .
You won't stand and fight .	You shall stand after midnight .
A dog from that house will make me angry enough to take a stand .	A southwest blow from heaven Will make a man welcome , Give me to my bottle .
If you sink , you're dragging love down .	If you be absent , I'll see you for yourself .
Is love really tender ?	Is not love fair ?
I think it's too rough , too rude , too rowdy , and it pricks like a thorn .	I think too young , too , a walking too , and it looks not like a beggar .
If love plays rough with you , play rough with Come on , let's knock and go in .	If love is quarrel with you , Put a week in the stocks And go with fear and hear .
Let playful people with light hearts dance .	Let us most show with your sword .
Come on , we're wasting precious daylight .	Come , sit on some ordinary time .
Let's go !	Let's go !
No we're not , it's night .	No , thou art no honest man .
We mean well by going to this masquerade ball , but it's not smart of us to go .	We mean well by this hour , but , being not yet gone , Nor we will not go .
Why , may I ask ?	Why , I will not ?
I had a dream last night .	I had a dream last night .
So did I .	So did I .
Well , what was your dream ?	Well , what was your cause ?
My dream told me that dreamers often lie .	My dream told me that was yours .
They lie in bed while they dream about the truth .	They lie in bed with certain tongues , though the devil commands .
Oh , then I see you've been with Who's Queen Mab ?	Oh , then I see The king of my best followers ?
Sometimes she rides over a courtier's lips , and he dreams of making money off of someone .	Thus she hath proved The tender of her death , And every of the false powers Hang against Caesar .
Sometimes she tickles a priest's nose with a Enough , enough !	Sometimes she holds a sweeter creature , to be afraid of free !
Mercutio , be quiet .	Prithee , be cheerful .
The wind you're talking about is blowing us off our course .	The wind sits on , and he is beaten , sure we will not .
Dinner is over , and we're going to get there too late .	This is early , and are we gone To get revenge on 't .
Onward , lover boys !	Out , loathed medicine !
Beat the drum .	Beat the warlike noise .
Where's Potpan ?	Where's Seleucus ?
When only one or two men have all the good manners , and even they are dirty , things are bad .	When only one or three men have seen up , And all the most of their absence , they seem naught .
Take away the stools , the sideboards , and the plates .	Take away the body , and the remainder , For all the world .
You , good friend , save me a piece of marzipan , and if you love me , have the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell .	You , good friend , Go in a cave , and if you love me , let the laws and pleasure Have in the audience .
Yes , boy , I'm ready .	Ay , boy , 'tis he .
They're looking for you in the great chamber .	Thou art armed for the murder of mine .
We can't be in two places at once , both here and there !	We shall not be in two ere noon , and there be friends !
Cheers , boys .	Yield , cur .
Be quick for a while and let the one who lives the longest take everything .	Be quick , for a while , and when the gods have one justice take .
Welcome , gentlemen .	Welcome , gentlemen .
Whichever of you acts shy , I'll swear she has corns .	Best of you drawn me , and she shall swear she has not .
Welcome , gentlemen .	Welcome , gentlemen .
I swear , it must be thirty years .	I prithee , it must be played ere day .
It's been longer , it's been longer .	Tis no jot , sir .
Lucentio's son is older than that , sir .	This is a soldier that is more foolishness .
He's thirty years old .	He's an admirable man .
Are you really going to tell me that ?	Are you not spoken to this ?
His son was a minor only two years ago .	His son was grown in a most ditch I cut .
I don't know , sir .	I know not , sir .
Oh , she shows the torches how to burn bright !	Oh , she makes the soul to see how bright and unnatural !
My eyes were liars , then , because I never saw true beauty before tonight .	My eyes were thick , but I might never see That never since lie again .
I can tell by his voice that this man is a Montague .	I can tell by his voice that is a man , an adder .
Why are you acting so angry ?	Why dost thou so hasty ?
Uncle , this man is a Montague , our enemy .	Uncle , this is a soldier's count , best to our own .
Is it young Romeo ?	Is it not a beggar ?
That's him , that villain Romeo .	That's him , that thou hast .
Calm down , gentle cousin .	Sit , gentle cousin .
Leave him alone .	Leave him alone .
He carries himself like a dignified gentleman , and , to tell you the truth , he has a reputation throughout Verona as a virtuous and well-behaved young man .	He himself is like a gentleman , and , to tell , you , the truth , he hath a man in a reverend shape and a man .
I wouldn't insult him in my own house for all the wealth in this town .	I would not spare in my own safety of the world , And in the last time of my brother .
So calm down .	So sit down .
Just ignore him .	Therefore prepare thee .
I won't tolerate him .	I shall devise him .
You But , uncle , we're being disrespected .	You , uncle , are you ruled by the means .
Go on , go on .	Go , go on .
You're an insolent little boy .	Thou art an honest man .
Is that how it is , really ?	Is that how it is , sir ?
I know what I'll do .	I know not what I do .
You have to contradict me , do you ?	You have me to do , sir ?
I'll teach you a lesson .	I'll teach you a wholesome answer .
Don't saints and pilgrims have lips too ?	Sawst thou no shame and that have I ?
Yes , pilgrim , they have lips that they're supposed to pray with .	Ay , faith , they have that they parted With better to love .
Well then , saint , let lips do what hands do .	Well then , let hands have thee , And let thy fortunes do .
Please grant my prayer so my faith doesn't turn to despair .	Please grant my prayer , so my mother , to my hands .
Saints don't move , even when they grant prayers .	We noted them not , for they bear some charity .
Then don't move while I act out my prayer .	Then weep not till I am a villain .
Now my sin has been taken from my lips by yours .	Now my cunning hath my former feature fair and patron , not by .
Then do my lips now have the sin they took from yours ?	Then do my lips have the sorrow That he hath laid from them ?
Sin from my lips ?	Hast thou forgot my daughter ?
Give me my sin back .	Give me my robe .
You kiss like you've studied how .	You kiss me , and how thou didst .
Madam , your mother wants to talk to you .	Madam , your mother wants to speak to you .
Who is her mother ?	Who is her name ?
I nursed her daughter , whom you were just talking to .	I took her daughter , and you were not wont to be so .
Let me tell you , the man who marries her will become very wealthy .	Let me tell you , the man that will make her speak but a fool .
No gentlemen , don't get ready to go now .	No gentlemen , you shall not go to hell .
We have a little dessert coming up .	We have a little galled me in this morning .
You're right .	Be it so .
The fight is between our masters , and we men who work for them .	The fight is , and our masters ' men , must be nothing but men .
It's all the same .	Tis all the day .
I'll be a harsh master to them .	I'll be a soldier to her .
Cut off their heads ?	Lie off their way ?
You mean their Cut off their heads , take their maidenheads , whatever .	You mean their heads ' sweetness , their senses must make sense of them .
Take my remark in whichever sense you like .	Take my finger Such you have seen me in .
The women you rape are the ones who'll have to "sense" it .	The heavens are women , it is the ones That have to preserve it .
Everybody knows I'm a nice piece of flesh .	Thou know'st 'tis common that thou art not .
It's a good thing you're not a piece of fish .	Tis a good thing , you're not a fool .
You're Pull out your tool now .	Thou bring'st me with thy distrust .
I have my naked sword out .	I have a noble sword .
Come over here , nurse .	Come hither , come hither .
Who is that gentleman ?	Who is that calls ?
He is the son and heir of old Tiberio .	He is the son of an ancient man .
Who's the one who's going out the door right now ?	Who's the moon with the king that's right , But now ?
Well , that one , I think , is young Petruchio .	Well , that one , I think , is true .
I don't know his name .	I know not his name .
Go ask .	Go fetch him .
What's this ?	What's this ?
What's this ?	What's this ?
The strangers are all gone .	The players are ready .
But he has to make his speeches of love to a woman who's supposed to be his enemy .	But he hath made his regards of the isle with him , and he hath laid a great answer without any means .
And Juliet's just as much in love as he , but she has even less opportunity to meet her lover .	And as thou didst , in love as she hath made him , And she hath worse to kill her .
But love gives them power , and time gives them the chance to meet , sweetening the extreme danger with intense pleasure .	But love them lend them gain and manage to part , The course will meet each other with the cause Of the same eye .
Can I go away while my heart stays here ?	Can I go hold away for my friends here ?
I bet he slipped away and went home to bed .	I warrant he comes to fetch Antony and to come forth .
He ran this way and jumped over this orchard wall .	He ran and this way goes on land , and there is done .
Call to him , Mercutio .	Call him to my tent .
I'll conjure him as if I were summoning a spirit .	I'll buckler thee For if thou hast been such a spirit .
Romeo !	Cessez !
Show yourself in the form of a sigh .	Show me in the necessity , and be a thief .
Speak one rhyme , and I'll be satisfied .	Speak the word , And therefore be thou .
Just cry out , "Ah me ! " Just say "love" and "dove." Say just one lovely word to my good friend	Therefore cry out , " quoth I , " and "Amen" Stuck in my throat , For one word not so deeply to take my name .
If he hears you , you'll make him angry .	If he can not , thou hast him not ill .
What I'm saying can't anger him .	What becomes of him is mad ?
The things I'm saying are fair and honest .	The things are fair and strong of my complexion .
His love is blind , so it belongs in the dark .	His love is truly , so it is in the dark .
If love is blind , it can't hit the target .	If love is common , it can not choose the promise .
Now he'll sit under a Let's go .	Now he'll sit under the corner and play himself .
There's no point in looking for him if he doesn't want to be found .	There's no composition in the world for him if he be not prepared to be found .
It is the east , and Juliet is the sun .	It is the day , and the sun is marred .
Virginity makes her look sick and green .	The powers of her most free show .
Let it go .	Let it go .
Oh , there's my lady !	Oh , there's my lady !
Oh , it is my love .	O , it is love indeed .
Oh , I wish she knew how much I love her .	Oh , I wish she knew how I love her .
She's talking , but she's not saying anything .	She's he , but not thou requests .
So what ?	So what ?
Her eyes are saying something .	Her eyes are fierce .
She's not talking to me .	She's not so good a man .
Two of the brightest stars in the whole sky had to go away on business , and they're asking her eyes to twinkle in their places until they return .	Two of the noblest man in the sky Is now to go on , And thou hast given her eyes to laughter at their till they are their preparation .
If her eyes were in the night sky , they would shine so brightly through space that birds would start singing , thinking her light was the light of day .	If her eyes were in the earth , they would shine that fire , so far That would light her round night , That light her breath was the day .
Look how she leans her hand on her cheek .	Look how she rubs her hand with her tongues .
Oh , I wish I was the glove on that hand so that I could touch that cheek .	Oh , I wish I was the son that love thee on me , that I could not choose a husband .
Oh , my !	Oh , my lord !
Who are you ?	Who are you ?
I hate my name , dear saint , because my name is your enemy .	I hate my name , But truly , my conscience , is thy name .
Aren't you Romeo ?	Whither are you going ?
And aren't you a Montague ?	And are you a strumpet ?
Tell me , how did you get in here ?	Tell me , how did you get in here ?
And why did you come ?	And wherefore did you come ?
If any of my relatives find you here they'll kill you because of who you are .	If any of my lords will find you there , You shall not know how you are .
Therefore your relatives are no obstacle .	Therefore your Honor is no worse .
If they see you , they'll murder you .	If they see , you shall , Macbeth .
Just look at me kindly , and I'm invincible against their hatred .	Therefore look upon him , and at least sound I not endure your offer .
I'd give anything to keep them from seeing you here .	I'll give thee to them , without thee meet me .
I'd rather they killed me than have to live without your love .	Sometime had rather me , Since Sycorax , my love , and thy love .
Otherwise , you'd see me blushing about the things you've heard me say tonight .	Truly , I might see me Out of the time , I hear me there .
Do you love me ?	Do you love me ?
I know you'll say "yes , " and I'll believe you .	I know not , " quoth I , To love and more .
What should I swear by ?	What should I do by ?
Don't swear at all .	Wonder not till well .
But if you have to swear , swear by your wonderful self , which is the god I worship like an idol , and then I'll believe you .	But if you have to swear by your hand , which is the glove which I am , and , by your rage , I'll say so .
If my heart's dear love , Well , don't swear .	If my dear love , I pray you , speak my fear .
Although you bring me joy , I can't take joy in this exchange of promises tonight .	Would you bring me word , I take you in this form of Venice , And bid me joy to this .
Our love , which right now is like a flower bud in the summer air , may turn out to be a beautiful flower by the next time we meet .	Our love , which is now i ' th ' dark , Can not look upon the blood of a lion , And so shall we be set forth .
I hope you enjoy the same sweet peace and rest I feel in my heart .	I hope you are the sweet one fair bed and well , I will in my heart .
Oh , are you going to leave me so unsatisfied ?	Oh , are you wont to rest me so ?
What satisfaction could you possibly have tonight ?	What satisfaction could you have ?
I pledged my love to you before you asked me to .	I am my love , before you bid me come .
Yet I wish I could take that promise back , so I had it to give again .	Yet I wish I could never take report of this , so I had to give it myself .
You would take it back ?	You would take it away ?
Why would you do that , my love ?	Why would you do that , my lord ?
Only to be generous and give it to you once more .	Only to be wise and give it me to this same .
But I'm wishing for something I already have .	But 'tis for the sport of it straight .
My generosity to you is as limitless as the sea , and my love is as deep .	My visor to thee as thou art , and thou thy looks , ne'er is as friendly as you .
I hear a noise inside .	I hear a noise .
Sweet Montague , be true .	Sweet , be thou true .
Stay here for a moment .	Stay here for a nunnery .
I'll come back .	I'll come again .
Oh , blessed , blessed night !	O blessed world , O thy soul !
Because it's dark out , I'm afraid all this is just a dream , too sweet to be real .	Because 'tis high , it is out of all , but so , to be a man too .
Three words , dear Romeo , and then it's good night for real .	Three months , good friends , and yet 'tis good , for then .
Don't worry about me .	Trust not Trebonius .
I Let's not break the law by starting a fight .	I shall not seal the leek by a noble wench .
Let them start something .	Let them start far .
I'll frown at them as they pass by , and they can react however they want .	I'll frown at them , as they pass by , they shall crack , and there shall be .
You mean however they dare .	You mean , they will .
I'll bite my thumb at them .	I'll ne'er tame my lips .
Hey , are you biting your thumb at us ?	Ho , thou hast misconstrued how the people sting him ?
I'm biting my thumb .	It is my birthday .
Are you biting your thumb at us ?	Are you your displeasure at , and ?
Are you trying to start a fight ?	Are you drawn to kiss and drown ?
Start a fight ?	Pale with a cat ?
No , sir .	No , sir .
Tomorrow I'll send the messenger .	Tomorrow I'll send the messenger .
My soul depends on it , A thousand times good night .	My soul upon it , hold it a little while .
Leaving you is a thousand times worse than being near you .	Best you safed a thousand harms that much wind may be beguiled .
Oh , I wish I could make a My soul is calling out my name .	Oh , I wish I could make a soul prove it , I can not scratch .
The sound of lovers calling each others names through the night is silver-sweet .	The sound of Caesar's words is toward the field , Not many goodly things .
Romeo !	Cessez !
My baby hawk ?	My wit's diseased ?
What time tomorrow should I send a messenger to you ?	What time should I bring a coward to you ?
By nine o'clock .	By twice but .
I won't fail .	I shall devise .
From now until then seems like twenty years .	From now till then , thou silver treasure and gone .
I have forgotten why I called you back .	I have forgot , I know not how .
Let me stand here until you remember your reason .	Let me stay here till you know your love .
I'll forget that I have any home besides this spot right here .	I'll warrant that I have any powers from this forest here .
It's almost morning .	Tis almost morning .
He lets the bird hop a little from his hand and then yanks him back by a string .	He hath the perfect man from this hand of his back To death by himself to walk a sensible man .
I wish I was your bird .	I wish I were your bird .
My sweet , so do I .	My sweet love , I do so .
But I would kill you by petting you too much .	But I would not urge thee by such another thing .
Good night , good night .	Good night , good night .
Parting is such sweet sorrow that I'll say good night until tonight becomes tomorrow .	It is such a bad prayer that I'll say such a good music till tomorrow .
I hope you sleep peacefully .	I hope you do not fit .
I wish I were Sleep and Peace , so I could spend the night with you .	I wish I were , and so , I could , so the gods may be with you .
Now I'll go see my priest , to ask for his help and tell him about my good luck .	Now I'll go my sister , And to assume that for his sake can not give him my good lord .
Darkness is stumbling out of the sun's path like a drunk man .	Friendship is hypocrisy against the color of a man , And a villain .
Now , before the sun comes up and burns away the dew , I have to fill this basket of mine with poisonous weeds and medicinal flowers .	Now , before the sun comes , and the remainder on thee , I have borne This wager in this holy world To dances and their proud .
The Earth is nature's mother and also nature's tomb .	The Turk is sharp and bold from the family's bed .
From the Earth's womb , many different sorts of plants and animals come forth , and the Earth provides her children with many excellent forms of nourishment .	From the bounds of the Nile , And many of many different fields , are come To wail the raging waters with the colors of the other .
Herbs , plants , and stones possess great power .	Unto the air , and most promising gilded change .
There is nothing on Earth that is so evil that it does not provide the earth with some special quality .	There is nothing on 't that says so , that it does not drink with the earth that have made some passion .
Virtue turns to vice if it's misused .	Thou hotly lust'st to be damned if she comes .
Inside the little rind of this weak flower , there is both poison and powerful medicine .	Interrupt the little melancholy of this weak , The sight of all this tribe , princes .
There are two opposite elements in everything , in men as well as in herbs , good and evil .	There are two lions in the sincerity of men , As in great judgment , as in fair nature .
When evil is dominant , death soon kills the body like cancer .	When this vile day shall thine own sense , for death .
Good morning , father .	Good morrow , father .
God bless you .	God bless you .
Who greets me so early in the morning ?	Who bids me here in the morning meet the night ?
Young man , something's wrong if you're getting out of bed this early .	Young man , thou canst not die , thou hast out of this twelvemonth in thy tent .
Every old man has worries , and worried men never get any sleep , but young men shouldn't have a care in the world .	Every old man hath granted , and often never did hear some offense but the poor men , To have a man in the world .
They should get to bed early and get plenty of sleep .	They should get hither to bed and be happy to hear of him .
Therefore , the fact that you're awake this early tells me you've been upset with some anxiety .	Therefore , the constable that are so contented That thou mayst tell me what thou hast seen .
If that's not the case , then this must be the answer : You , Romeo , have not been to bed tonight .	If that's not the case , then this must be the answer : You have not been here , not to have bed with Cassio .
Your last guess is right .	Your last news is not .
I enjoyed a sweeter rest than sleep .	I am a woman's soldier , and not sleep .
With Rosaline , father ?	With what , father ?
That's good , my boy .	That's good , my lord .
But where have you been ?	But where have you been ?
I'll tell you before you have to ask me again .	I'll tell you that you shall have me again .
You have the sacred power to cure both of us .	You have the power to make us well , You are not .
I carry no hatred , holy man , because my request will benefit my enemy .	I carry no discipline , most gracious , when my daughter will win my death .
