Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift .	I've noticed it a stranger once .
Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set On the fair daughter of rich Capulet .	Then plainly , my dear love , is the beautiful Hero of my daughter , and my noble queen .
As mine on hers , so hers is set on mine , And all combined , save what thou must combine By holy marriage .	As mine eyes on , so many times on her , I'll set up with all the graces you know , he'll be as good as you were .
When and where and how We met , we wooed and made exchange of vow , I'll tell thee as we pass , but this I pray : That thou consent to marry us today .	When we're and when I met them , and we can make fun of him , don't tell me as we can tell you , but I don't know who you've met me to bed and marry us .
Holy Saint Francis , what a change is here !	Saint Davy's Day , a little mistake you all !
Is Rosaline , whom thou didst love so dear , So soon forsaken ?	Is that why , since I've ever heard so much , so then ?
Young men's love then lies Not truly in their hearts , but in their eyes .	Young people love their mother said in the blood , but their own safety lies in their words .
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears , Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears .	The sun is not yet from your brother , and you have been wrong in the king's company , my lords , and my innocence .
Lo , here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit Of an old tear that is not washed off yet .	Look over here , your lines and your great-uncle don't the same with your own help , which is not getting up yet .
If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine , Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline .	If anyone who abuses these obstacles , she'll keep this bloody evidence , and it must be as easy for you .
And art thou changed ?	And you're not dead ?
Pronounce this sentence then : Women may fall when there's no strength in men .	Pronounce this day and then : anyone who can have no sense of honor as in the world .
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline .	I've told you everything I am for young .
For doting , not for loving , pupil mine .	For it's not true , you stupid man .
And badest me bury love .	And Walter doesn't want to be brave .
Not in a grave , To lay one in , another out to have .	Not in a grave and eyes , there's one to see you , there's been a little tired of it .
I pray thee , chide not .	I don't feel anything wrong .
The other did not so .	The other thing just is told .
Oh , she knew well Thy love did read by rote , that could not spell .	Oh , she was well heard that well , by giving it your handkerchief , so that can not .
But come , young waverer , come , go with me , In one respect I'll thy assistant be , For this alliance may so happy prove To turn your households ' rancor to pure love .	But come , come , you're going to rest with me , I'll break your own treasure and be happy , as you may get , so much as to kiss your own , and so I'll beg your own to stop .
Oh , let us hence .	Oh , let us see .
I stand on sudden haste .	I stand on with the heat .
Wisely and slow .	Large and increasing .
They stumble that run fast .	They swore that she loves me .
Where the devil should this Romeo be ?	Where the moon should be savage ?
Came he not home tonight ?	Wasn't he coming home tonight ?
Not to his father's .	Not to his brother .
I spoke with his man .	I spoke with his father .
Why , that same pale hard-hearted wench , that Rosaline , Torments him so , that he will sure run mad .	Why , that same pale , giantlike ox-beef herself followed you so that , and he himself will run away his way .
Tybalt , the kinsman to old Capulet , Hath sent a letter to his father's house .	Kneel , the old man wants to pay back to the senate house , with a new crown now .
A challenge , on my life .	A nice coincidence , my lord .
Romeo will answer it .	He will answer it .
Any man that can write may answer a letter .	Any man that can't answer me than answer for a husband .
Nay , he will answer the letter's master , how he dares , being dared .	Yes , he will answer the necklace , master , he can not get married .
Alas , poor Romeo !	Alas , poor ghost !
And is he a man to encounter Tybalt ?	And is he married a man ?
Why , what is Tybalt ?	Why , what is that ?
The what ?	The what ?
Without his roe , like a dried herring .	Nothing was his own , but a cramp .
O flesh , flesh , how art thou fishified !	Oh , mighty duke , how a whore !
Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in .	Now he is for the first that he has sex in the world .
Good morrow to you both .	Good morning to you both .
What counterfeit did I give you ?	What did I try to do ?
The slip , sir , the slip .	The wiser , sir , the gown .
Can you not conceive ?	Can you really be ?
Nay , I am the very pink of courtesy .	Yes , I am the very expert in my memory .
I serve as good a man as you .	I serve you as a good man as yourself .
No better .	No more .
Well , sir .	Well , sir .
You lie .	You lie .
You know not what you do .	You don't know what to do .
What , art thou drawn among these heartless hinds ?	What , aren't you drowned and wondering about this ?
Come between us , good Benvolio .	Come on , you are like a liar .
My wits faints .	My ships are maneuverable .
Switch and spurs , switch and spurs , or I'll cry a match .	Eat and eat , and I'll dance , or else I'll get to forget a little .
Nay , if our wits run the wild-goose chase , I am done , for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits than , I am sure , I have in my whole five .	Yes , if our hands get the circle over it , I wouldn't have to say something about the other men in the one , I'm not sure , in fact , I have to have my own breath .
Was I with you there for the goose ?	Was I sent for you in the dumps ?
Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not there for the goose .	I've never seen with you since I should be here for the things you need for me .
I will bite thee by the ear for that jest .	I will stop around and tell you that by them .
Nay , good goose , bite not .	Yes , just good , mangy rascal .
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting .	Your wit is very courtly a bad luck .
It is a most sharp sauce .	I'm being a virgin , most scurvy monster .
And is it not well served into a sweet goose ?	And it is not really brave of you , stop ?
Oh , here's a wit of cheveril , that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad !	Oh , a lame woman , a thousand of your absence , not getting to become a flattering , gentle , capable !
I stretch it out for that word "broad , " which , added to the goose , proves thee far and wide a broad goose .	I picked it out that for me , it's not the one , unless the poet and the people are looking at his feet , like a common story .
Why , is not this better now than groaning for love ?	Why , is not this better thing to praise for me ?
Now art thou sociable .	Now you're talking about it .
Now art thou Romeo .	Now you're talking about it .
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large .	I've told you everything I have an idea .
Oh , thou art deceived .	Oh , you're not feeling well .
I would have made it short , for I was come to the whole depth of my tale , and meant , indeed , to occupy the argument no longer .	I would have made it well , but I was going to be the one of my kingdom , it's true , and the third to do it , the same .
Here's goodly gear .	Here's a nasty garter .
Two , two , a shirt and a smock .	Two or three , a fool , has ruined a pearl like this .
Peter !	Peter !
Anon !	Good-bye !
My fan , Peter .	My name's Roderigo , calm down .
God ye good morrow , gentlemen .	God be good , gentlemen .
God ye good e'en , fair gentlewoman .	God be good , uncle I'm possessed .
Is it good e'en ?	Is it good , madam ?
Tis no less , I tell you , for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon .	It's no matter , I tell you , the sun is right for the other of the sea , leaving the ocean off with me .
Out upon you !	Stop right there !
What a man are you ?	What a man are you ?
One , gentlewoman , that God hath made , himself to mar .	One , Moor , that has always a ghost , to him .
By my troth , it is well said .	By my troth , I'm still a liar .
For himself to mar , " quoth he ?	For himself to act , wherever he says .
Gentlemen , can any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo ?	Gentlemen , can any control of you who I can tell you the same story ?
I can tell you , but young Romeo will be older when you have found him than he was when you sought him .	I can tell you , but young , you will be better when I have him , but he was speaking to you when he was .
I am the youngest of that name , for fault of a worse .	I am the son of that name , for a simple sin I'm telling you .
You say well .	You say well .
Yea , is the worst well ?	Yes , the worst is all the words ?
Very well took , i ' faith , wisely , wisely .	Very well , sir , by your beards , yes , a devil .
She will indite him to some supper .	She will drink to us all to dinner .
So ho !	So !
What hast thou found ?	What did you say ?
Romeo , will you come to your father's ?	Niece , will you come to your uncle's ?
We'll to dinner , thither .	We'll go to dinner tomorrow .
I will follow you .	I will follow you .
A gentleman , Nurse , that loves to hear himself talk , and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month .	A gentleman , sir , that wonders to hear someone will speak , and speak a little more in the moon , he will get a little more in my belly .
An he speak any thing against me , I'll take him down , an he were lustier than he is , and twenty such Jacks .	An he speak about God's name , or I'll take him up at the marketplace , like an ass , like a girl , he pulled out their fangs .
And if I can not , I'll find those that shall .	And if I could , it'll be with men or never can say .
Scurvy knave !	You lowlife son-of-a-bitch !
I am none of his flirt-gills .	I am none of his own .
I am none of his skains-mates .	I am none of his own .
I saw no man use you at his pleasure .	I saw no man any of your command than a brother .
If I had , my weapon should quickly have been out , I warrant you .	If I had my choice , I'd have it out of Pompey I can like you .
I dare draw as soon as another man if I see occasion in a good quarrel and the law on my side .	I dare argue with him as soon as I see a man , and in my conscience that I have a good way to hang Benedick .
Now , afore God , I am so vexed that every part about me quivers .	Now , Balthazar , I am sure that Lady Justice is like a piece of feather .
Scurvy knave !	You lowlife son-of-a-bitch !
Nurse , commend me to thy lady and mistress .	Anyway , to your lady , to me .
I protest unto thee , Good heart , and i ' faith , I will tell her as much .	I swear to you , both of poetry , and I will tell you as much as I know , either .
Lord , Lord , she will be a joyful woman .	Lord , Lord , he will be a virgin .
What wilt thou tell her , Nurse ?	What did you want to tell her ?
Thou dost not mark me .	You've got it not .
And there she shall at Friar Lawrence ' cell Be shrived and married .	And there she won't smile at the country , and they're crying from hardship .
And stay , good Nurse .	And stay , good man .
Behind the abbey wall Within this hour my man shall be with thee And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair , Which to the high top-gallant of my joy Must be my convoy in the secret night .	Picture the bat lies protected in this forest , with my own heart to beat you with a little while , even though the small push makes up the kind of night , my boy , and my children in the other .
Farewell .	Farewell .
Be trusty , and I'll quit thy pains .	Be quiet , I'll go on your bedroom .
Farewell .	Farewell .
Commend me to thy mistress .	Don't ask me to suicide again .
Now God in heaven bless thee !	Now God save you in Rome !
Hark you , sir .	Hello , sir .
What sayst thou , my dear Nurse ?	What are you doing , my dear Bianca ?
Is your man secret ?	Is your father coming ?
Did you ne'er hear say , "Two may keep counsel , putting one away" ?	Did you say anything , my friend , could keep you getting around and drown yourself ?
Warrant thee , my man's as true as steel .	Don't worry , my lord , as soon as a man's son .
Well , sir , my mistress is the sweetest lady. , Lord , Lord !	Well , sir , my mistress is the moon , like the Lord of Scotland !
when 'twas a little prating thing. , Oh , there is a nobleman in town , one Paris , that would fain lay knife aboard , but she , good soul , had as lief see a toad , a very toad , as see him .	And when a jealous ago I've been a guest of France , there is a little one , that "many" would lay on it , but she would be as good as a saint , but as a nice man , as a sacrifice .
I anger her sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer man .	I anger her and tell her that she was the man , the man .
But , I'll warrant you , when I say so , she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world .	But , I'll forget , I'll assume you who was so low as he's a girl in the garden for where you heard the world .
Doth not Ay , Nurse , what of that ?	Doesn't everyone want me , because of that ?
Both with an Ah , mocker , that's the dog's name .	Both with your insolent retinue , isn't often the same of it , my lord .
Commend me to thy lady .	Don't ask me to suicide again .
Ay , a thousand times. , Peter !	Yes , a thousand and handsome man !
Anon !	Good-bye !
Before and apace .	Before your lines too .
The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse .	The clock hasn't struck till he was the woman I've spent .
Perchance she can not meet him .	Maybe she can not stand .
That's not so .	That's not so .
Oh , she is lame !	Oh , she is virtuous !
Love's heralds should be thoughts , Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams , Driving back shadows over louring hills .	Neither kind that should be taken than the penalty , and since the Venetian ship was tossed by the sea , and they've been scolded .
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill Of this day's journey , and from nine till twelve Is three long hours , yet she is not come .	Now the sun is sailing , the white head of this shook : the clouds and rain blowing still through the streets , though it fought for you , come here .
Had she affections and warm youthful blood , She would be as swift in motion as a ball .	I've sworn her father's death , and then throw over her heart as a sacrificial lamb .
My words would bandy her to my sweet love , And his to me .	My words would move to my own bed , and make her a humble leave .
But old folks , many feign as they were dead , Unwieldy , slow , heavy , and pale as lead .	But old Frederick , as many as they were dead , then , as huge as this , " and grim .
O God , she comes. , O honey Nurse , what news ?	Oh God , she cried , you goddess , get sad !
Hast thou met with him ?	You're talking with him ?
Send thy man away .	Send an excellent word .
Peter , stay at the gate .	Peter , stay at the synagogue .
Now , good sweet Nurse , O Lord , why look'st thou sad ?	Now , good sweet , don't you think how fond you talk about ?
Though news be sad , yet tell them merrily .	Though you be sad , you'll tell me what's going on .
If good , thou shamest the music of sweet news By playing it to me with so sour a face .	If you're good , the duke's words of all this silly , my lord , to remember so much a mother .
I am aweary .	I am hers .
Give me leave awhile .	Give me leave now .
Fie , how my bones ache !	Damn it , my poor lord !
I would thou hadst my bones and I thy news .	I would have sworn my enemies , and your news .
Can you not stay awhile ?	Can you just stay here ?
Do you not see that I am out of breath ?	Do you see that I don't see being out of your family ?
How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath ?	How are you out of breath and fresh wounds , that you have to pull me out of your breath like that ?
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse .	The excuse that I don't have any other than a larger dog , the same thing I can .
Is thy news good , or bad ?	Is your news good , bad luck ?
Answer to that .	Answer me that .
Say either , and I'll stay the circumstance .	Say anything , and I'll stay here to the same .
Let me be satisfied .	Let me be satisfied .
Is 't good or bad ?	Is it good or bad ?
Well , you have made a simple choice .	Well , you have a bad influence .
You know not how to choose a man .	You know how to kiss a cat .
Romeo !	Halt !
No , not he , though his face be better than any man's , yet his leg excels all men's , and for a hand and a foot and a body , though they be not to be talked on , yet they are past compare .	No , just , though he only want his heart to be taken than his own hair , and not for his death , which is a great tragedy to be remembered , and not by being taken at all , but they don't have to be married .
He is not the flower of courtesy , but , I'll warrant him , as gentle as a lamb .	He is the only one woman , but I'm sure , I'll assume that your Majesty is as dear as a Roman .
Go thy ways , wench .	Go on your home , sir .
Serve God .	Serve God .
What , have you dined at home ?	What , have you forgotten Caesar's marks ?
No , no .	No , no .
But all this did I know before .	But all this did have I ended .
What says he of our marriage ?	What does he say about the marriage ?
What of that ?	What about that ?
My back a ' t ' other side .	My back was a nice message from your Majesty .
Ah , my back , my back !	Ah , my lord , this morning !
I ' faith , I am sorry that thou art not well .	I ' faith , I swear I'm not as well as I .
Sweet , sweet , sweet Nurse , tell me , what says my love ?	Sweet sweet , reverend mistress , don't you know me , what is my love ?
Your love says , like an honest gentleman , and a courteous , and a kind , and a handsome , and , I warrant , a virtuous , Where is your mother ?	Your love is just an idiot , and a poor and handsome man , a kind and handsome man , and I , like a king , a poor man , your son , and my father ?
Where is my mother ?	Where is my mother ?
Why , she is within .	Why , she is gone .
Where should she be ?	Where should she be ?
How oddly thou repliest !	How amazing is she !
Your love says , like an honest gentleman , 'Where is your mother ?	Your love , like God's name , is young George , your highness ?
O God's lady dear , Are you so hot ?	Oh , dear lady , will you be brave ?
Marry , come up , I trow .	Yeah , right , come , I can .
Is this the poultice for my aching bones ?	Is this the job you lent in mind ?
Henceforward do your messages yourself .	Don't do your hatred .
Here's such a coil .	Here's a bad thing .
Come , what says Romeo ?	Come , what does he say ?
Have you got leave to go to shrift today ?	Have you snuck away to bed and see them ?
I have .	I have .
Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence's cell .	Then you come to kill me , you're dead .
There stays a husband to make you a wife .	There isn't a husband to make you obey it .
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks .	Now the candle gets up and be happy , your spirits .
They'll be in scarlet straight at any news .	They'll be exhibited in anything more than hell .
Hie you to church .	Don't bother with me .
I must another way To fetch a ladder , by the which your love Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark .	I must needs a nice way to show you , which the parents of their estate is making me right , and when it is a day , it's a lie .
Go .	Go .
I'll to dinner .	I'll go to dinner .
Hie you to the cell .	Don't bother with the snake .
I do but keep the peace .	I do as well live in the marketplace .
Put up thy sword , Or manage it to part these men with me .	Put up your sword on your side , and I'll make it the power to obey you .
What , drawn , and talk of peace ?	What , everybody , and what of him ?
I hate the word , As I hate hell , all Montagues , and thee .	I hate the word , as I hate heaven , and you , all the world , you .
Have at thee , coward !	Have at you , Roderigo !
Clubs , bills , and partisans !	Sorry , sir , a fine and excellent !
Strike !	Strike !
Beat them down !	Beat him up !
Down with the Capulets !	Down with the topmast !
Down with the Montagues !	Down with the topmast !
What noise is this ?	What about this is that ?
My sword , I say !	My sword , I say !
Old Montague is come , And flourishes his blade in spite of me .	Old George is come near , and I'm not going to break in a stool .
Thou villain Capulet !	Evil villain !
Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe .	I've never been hurt to make you like a husband .
Hie to high fortune !	Don't move for grief !
Honest Nurse , farewell .	Honest , farewell , Cassius .
Amen , amen .	Amen , hope .
But come what sorrow can , It can not countervail the exchange of joy That one short minute gives me in her sight .	But come on what you'd show up , the Norwegian man who can use you in the better positions of love and a little stream .
Therefore love moderately .	Just love me .
Long love doth so .	Heaven does so much .
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow .	Too bad I'm doing so , as you .
Here comes the lady .	Here comes the lady .
Oh , so light a foot Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint .	Oh , so horrible a day could cover around a while in your eyes !
Good even to my ghostly confessor .	Good to you , my dear lord .
Romeo shall thank thee , daughter , for us both .	Whatever I thank you , your Grace would be both bitter .
As much to him , else is his thanks too much .	As much to him , I'm telling you his reasons will be too much .
Ah , Juliet , if the measure of thy joy Be heaped like mine , and that thy skill be more To blazon it , then sweeten with thy breath This neighbor air , and let rich music's tongue Unfold the imagined happiness that both Receive in either by this dear encounter .	Ah , if the hearer is the rest of your lust , and your sorrow and his freedom will be willing to be harassed by your airy breath and crying , with ten thousand Frenchmen who long will be branded with your poor actions and your own children and my heart .
Conceit , more rich in matter than in words , Brags of his substance , not of ornament .	Ruining his frail voice , in fact , being in a nice shape , though he's not a traitor .
Come , come with me , and we will make short work .	Come on , let's go with you , and make me free .
I pray thee , good Mercutio , let's retire .	I want to keep good news , please .
Thou art like one of those fellows that , when he enters the confines of a tavern , claps me his sword upon the table and says "God send me no need of thee ! " and , by the operation of the second cup , draws it on the drawer when indeed there is no need .	I've been like many of those that other lines , the goddess of his rage , the greatness of a lion and his indignations , and the rest of his new coat does not look at , and turn the rest of the cushion , just like the gold , there is no need to play it .
Am I like such a fellow ?	Am I a married man or the penalty ?
Come , come , thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy , and as soon moved to be moody , and as soon moody to be moved .	Come on , let's be as ugly as a weed in a warren in this forest , as if it's as right to be as difficult and used to be as powerful as you were .
And what to ?	And what about Cicero ?
Nay , an there were two such , we should have none shortly , for one would kill the other .	Yes , an old man there were such a little one , we should be hanged now and send for some other men .
Thou , why , thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast .	You're Launcelot , you can play a man with a woman who was supposed to be a beard by getting a little more than a monkey .
Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts , having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes .	You've kept a quarrel with a job for a little , but it'll be more appropriate for your little than you can make .
What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel ?	What an eye of his reputation would just be a tone of disapproval ?
Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat , and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarreling .	Your head is as full of white as snow and your hair , and so much as your own , I'm not able to stroll and relax , not as well as a military man .
Thou hast quarreled with a man for coughing in the street because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun .	I've been looking for a little in the forest for a bit of your own , but he doesn't have that private thousands more in the ground .
Didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter ?	Didn't I see a fight with a girl or his means , leaving the afternoon with his finger ?
With another , for tying his new shoes with old ribbon ?	With another , for our own sake , what is our luck ?
And yet thou wilt tutor me from quarreling !	And yet she doesn't mean any , then ?
An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art , any man should buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter .	An I were so nice to you as any man who can call the price of his death , for my own half the world to be taken against .
The fee simple ?	The life" is being going ?
O simple !	Oh , excellent !
By my head , here comes the Capulets .	By my head , here comes the sweaty lord .
By my heel , I care not .	By my troth , I don't have a care .
Couple it with something .	Don't be upset with me .
Make it a word and a blow .	Don't give it a ring so carefully .
You shall find me apt enough to that , sir , an you will give me occasion .	You couldn't find me enough to assume that you don't like an old man , you will give me to .
Could you not take some occasion without giving ?	Could you take care of this an idea ?
Mercutio , thou consort'st with Romeo .	Ladies , you're dropping bread from the heavens .
What , dost thou make us minstrels ?	What , are you trying to make us ?
An thou make minstrels of us , look to hear nothing but discords .	An if you had rational human minds to get him , but not to say something about it .
We talk here in the public haunt of men .	We talk about this in the dark of the night .
Either withdraw unto some private place , And reason coldly of your grievances , Or else depart .	Either send some packing that , even though our person has been seen nothing , but that doesn't worry me .
Here all eyes gaze on us .	Here all other men's faces are .
Men's eyes were made to look and let them gaze .	These eyes were made up sleep , and they couldn't get it .
I will not budge for no man's pleasure , I .	I will not speak any more than your cousin will .
Well , peace be with you , sir .	Well , peace , be careful with you .
Here comes my man .	Here comes my lord .
But I'll be hanged , sir , if he wear your livery .	But I'll be nearby , and I'll stop when he has to see you .
Tybalt , the reason that I have to love thee Doth much excuse the appertaining rage To such a greeting .	Kinsmen , the reason that I want to speak to you , it's better to be flouted in the place to keep a schoolmaster .
Villain am I none .	Actually I am nothing .
Therefore , farewell .	Therefore , farewell .
I see thou know'st me not .	I see you're crying from the Tower .
Boy , this shall not excuse the injuries That thou hast done me .	Boy , this doesn't share the hard thing to let you know me .
Therefore turn and draw .	Just turn around and stop worrying .
And so , good Capulet , which name I tender As dearly as my own , be satisfied .	And so , good morning , which I really feel my mother as well as any , my lord .
O calm dishonourable , vile submission !	Oh , calm , wicked , scoundrel !
What wouldst thou have with me ?	What can you have to do with me ?
Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears ?	Will you stick your sword and your daughters out of the city ?
Make haste , lest mine be about your ears ere it be out .	Make haste , hold , and be sure of your heart when you talk .
I am for you .	I feel for you .
Gentle Mercutio , put thy rapier up .	Gentle madam , put your iron hands on me .
Away , Tybalt .	Listen to me .
I am hurt .	I am hurt .
A plague o ' both your houses !	A plague on your crafty gaping open ! ,
I am sped .	I am .
Is he gone and hath nothing ?	Is he standing and happy ?
What , art thou hurt ?	What , you're going to die ?
Marry , 'tis enough .	Meanwhile , it's possible .
Where is my page ? , Go , villain , fetch a surgeon .	Where is my messenger. , Go , and talk to a while .
Courage , man .	Definitely not , man .
The hurt can not be much .	The same thing you can speak .
No , 'tis not so deep as a well nor so wide as a church-door , but 'tis enough , 'twill serve .	No , I'm not so fine a maiden , as you were like a blustery winter in the king's , it's not a maiden , but not a whore .
Ask for me tomorrow , and you shall find me a grave man .	Ask me for everything , and you can find me a hundred and my brother .
I am peppered , I warrant , for this world .	I am sorry , I don't know how much of it .
A plague o ' both your houses !	A plague on your crafty gaping open ! ,
Zounds , a dog , a rat , a mouse , a cat to scratch a man to death !	Jesus , a mouse ! , Come , a couple , a dove , a toy for a woman !
A braggart , a rogue , a villain that fights by the book of arithmetic !	A coward , a sore , a villain that you find is called by the worthier clothes the dust !
Why the devil came you between us ?	Why the devil got you safely ?
I was hurt under your arm .	I was knocking at your service .
I thought all for the best .	I thought all of the whole time .
Help me into some house , Benvolio , Or I shall faint .	Help me into a house , and I'm going to get you .
A plague o ' both your houses !	A plague on your crafty gaping open ! ,
They have made worms ' meat of me .	They have made me fight twenty of the island .
I have it , And soundly too .	I have it , and I am looking for you .
Your houses !	Your bedroom !
O Romeo , Romeo , brave Mercutio is dead !	Oh , chest , oh , brave York !
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again .	Here comes the Emperor : come up .
Alive in triumph , and Mercutio slain !	He's in Egypt with a level field , boys !
Either thou or I , or both , must go with him .	Either I or three , or I , don't fight with him .
Thou , wretched boy , that didst consort him here Shalt with him hence .	He's a traitor , since you interrupt him here with the smoke , on his house I'll challenge you .
This shall determine that .	This won't happen that .
Romeo , away , be gone !	Hurry , away , be crazy !
The citizens are up , and Tybalt slain .	The citizens are ready , and I'm ready .
Stand not amazed .	Listen to me .
The Prince will doom thee death If thou art taken .	The Prince will always be angry with you about your face .
Hence , be gone , away !	Listen , listen , up !
Why dost thou stay ?	Why are you crying ?
Which way ran he that killed Mercutio ?	Which way goes he that sees for ?
Tybalt , that murderer , which way ran he ?	Wasn't that Benedick , a lot of Caesar's will ?
There lies that Tybalt .	There lies that time .
Speak , nephew .	Speak , boy .
Were you by when it began ?	Were you thinking about it before ?
Where are the vile beginners of this fray ?	Where are the parents of this war ?
O noble prince , I can discover all The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl .	Oh noble prince , I can explain this the rumors to be a surgeon to this doctor .
There lies the man , slain by young Romeo , That slew thy kinsman , brave Mercutio .	There lies the man , he's called by poisonous , and religious people , look after my act .
Tybalt , my cousin !	Don't go , my lord .
O my brother's child !	Oh , my poor child !
O cousin , cousin !	Oh , cousin , cousin !
Benvolio , who began this bloody fray ?	Oh , who are this bloody family ?
Romeo , he cries aloud , "Hold , friends !	Oh , he cries , 'Stop !
Friends , part ! " and , swifter than his tongue , His agile arm beats down their fatal points , And 'twixt them rushes , underneath whose arm An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life Of stout Mercutio , and then Tybalt fled .	Friends , take off , " and his tongue speaks more than his own hair , through the ocean off their heads , which sighing and shook their graves match up , and then the same way makes the throne empty .
But by and by comes back to Romeo , Who had but newly entertained revenge , And to 't they go like lightning , for ere I Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain .	But by running down and see , I've got to be revenged on the ground , and they won't stand for food to catch the living , which I had to go to them .
And , as he fell , did Romeo turn and fly .	And , as he fell , then I can join the last thing and strong .
This is the truth , or let Benvolio die .	This is the job , if the Romans didn't die .
He speaks not true .	He speaks bluntly .
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife , And all those twenty could but kill one life .	Some of them were in this recent storm , not in the water and could not make the poor men who had wings that ever loved and was a man .
I beg for justice , which thou , Prince , must give .	I thank God for your sake , which is just the way I can .
Romeo slew Tybalt .	I've noticed it .
Romeo must not live .	Discipline must be .
Romeo slew him ; he slew Mercutio .	I've noticed him because he feels like a coward .
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe ?	Who now is the name of his love and your Majesty ?
His fault concludes but what the law should end , The life of Tybalt .	His fault is just the way , but the truth I should have thought about it .
I have an interest in your hearts ' proceeding .	I have an aunt in your power for you .
But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine That you shall all repent the loss of mine .	But I'll tell you very much of this : you can't stand the marriage of your daughter , you both of the other .
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses .	I will be correspondent to both and then .
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses , Therefore use none .	Nor tears of blood , she'll shed any blood , and use the word .
Bear hence this body and attend our will .	Don't go out this way and keep our offer .
Mercy but murders , pardoning those that kill .	Mercy , but those that are getting like this .
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites By their own beauties , or , if love be blind , It best agrees with night .	Let's try to see their frightened voices , to their husbands , if only , if the person were true , not our bad luck .
Come , civil night , Thou sober-suited matron , all in black , And learn me how to lose a winning match Played for a pair of stainless maidenhoods .	Come on , poor wretch , using all this terrible night , complaining to the moon , like a whirlpool , draws others in such a prison as the whole world .
Hood my unmanned blood bating in my cheeks , With thy black mantle , till strange love , grow bold , Think true love acted simple modesty .	Dressing my out-and-out wickedness in scraps of Scripture , I look at your face , so long as I'm afraid , we'll be true a man .
Come , night .	Come on , boy .
Come , Romeo .	Come on , shovel .
Come , thou day in night , For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back .	Come on , we're in one time , and you go like the night of this terrible forest , playing the day we acted at all .
And when I shall die , Take him and cut him out in little stars , And he will make the face of heaven so fine That all the world will be in love with night And pay no worship to the garish sun .	And when I die , will cut up the heart and have him out in the mud on the earth , and he will make the love of all the world in the world , even if he could be able to pay the price of this devil .
The cords That Romeo bid thee fetch ?	The highest-ranking who has kept you back ?
Ay , ay , the cords .	Yes , yes , the devil .
Ay me , what news ?	Yes , what news ?
Why dost thou wring thy hands ?	Why are you chewing on his lower lip ?
Ah , welladay !	Ah , Rosencrantz !
We are undone , lady , we are undone !	We are spoiled , victorious men , we're awake !
Alack the day !	Oh-ho-ho the day !
Can heaven be so envious ?	Can heaven be so happy ?
Romeo can , Though heaven can not .	Actually , I'll be sworn to ever .
What devil art thou that dost torment me thus ?	What traitor can you have to remember that you're reading ?
This torture should be roared in dismal hell .	This story should be in our cursed and now .
Hath Romeo slain himself ?	Wasn't he getting around ?
Say thou but "ay , " And that bare vowel Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice .	Say you're not speaking well , " and that the devil himself will be taken of it .
I am not I if there be such an Or those eyes shut that makes thee answer "ay." If he be slain , say "ay , " or if not , "no." Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe .	I am not if there were any other men who only show their honors for that he wouldn't get back to say , "Do you like , "Oh , or even less than my shoe .
To prison , eyes , ne'er look on liberty .	To prison , until I put a man's back .
Vile earth , to earth resign .	Imagine , earth , to earth .
O Tybalt , Tybalt , the best friend I had !	Oh , chest , the ladies , not a little man !
That ever I should live to see thee dead .	That ever I should live to see you know he's dead .
Is Romeo slaughtered , and is Tybalt dead ?	Is it feasible , and that is dead ?
My dearest cousin and my dearer lord ?	My dearest sister , my sweet and
Tybalt is gone , and Romeo banished .	I'm standing here , and I'm dying .
O God , did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood ?	Oh God , did you see the blood of her ?
It did , it did .	It did you , sir .
Alas the day , it did .	Alas the day , it wasn't me .
O serpent heart hid with a flowering face !	Oh , wretched , has a word with thee !
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave ?	Did anyone ever courted a lovely love ?
Dove-feathered raven , wolvish-ravening lamb !	Girls , girls , soldiers !
O nature , what hadst thou to do in hell When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend In moral paradise of such sweet flesh ?	Oh , what evil world can do to be in hell when you could make a living in the world , that the devil would become a man to wash up ?
Was ever book containing such vile matter So fairly bound ?	Was ever handkerchief " my lord , but how nice ?
Ah , where's my man ? , Give me some aqua vitae. , These griefs , these woes , these sorrows make me old .	Ah , my lord , this ring has said some of you , male twins , both the wretches that , these people and these ways to make me happy .
Shame come to Romeo !	Shame on you , Jessica !
Blistered be thy tongue For such a wish !	Don't be damned for your master's mind , oh !
He was not born to shame .	He was just like to say it .
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit , For 'tis a throne where honor may be crowned .	Upon his soul there is as easy as you , and I'm starting to lose a passion except you , and my daughter .
Sole monarch of the universal earth , Oh , what a beast was I to chide at him !	Wicked woman in the middle of a lion , who was always a man that was to him at the window !
Will you speak well of him that killed your cousin ?	Will you speak well of this that time on me ?
But wherefore , villain , didst thou kill my cousin ?	But why , why , did you kill this sweet handkerchief ?
That villain cousin would have killed my husband .	That villain Jew would have my husband taken .
All this is comfort .	All this is going .
Wherefore weep I then ?	Didn't I weep for it ?
I would forget it fain , But oh , it presses to my memory , Like damned guilty deeds to sinners ' minds .	I would catch it , since , my prophet , it would be nice to me about my life , which was a great tragedy to sweetness of you .
Tybalt is dead , and Romeo banished."	His name is dead , and I'm depressed .
That "banished , " that one word "banished" Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts .	That happens , boys , that one word has no other than a variety , the forest over Venice .
Tybalt's death Was woe enough , if it had ended there .	Nobody death ago , since it's time , and everything would have it .
Or , if sour woe delights in fellowship And needly will be ranked with other griefs , Why followed not , when she said "Tybalt's dead , " "Thy father" or "thy mother , " nay , or both , Which modern lamentations might have moved ?	Or , if she weren't angry in him , will be willing to eat with you , and I said she didn't have restrained when she was buried with the earth , "and , or perhaps , or blind , or many , or other , or perhaps ?
But with a rearward following Tybalt's death , "Romeo is banished." To speak that word , Is father , mother , Tybalt , Romeo , Juliet , All slain , all dead .	But with a series of legal writs , he doesn't need to speak that name , because my father , his son , is dead , and all the other is .
Romeo is banished." There is no end , no limit , measure , bound , In that word's death .	There is no indication of the world , no tongue , but every one , that unfortunate he , can not utter me .
No words can that woe sound .	No words can that sound like me .
Where is my father and my mother , Nurse ?	Where is my mother and my mother ?
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse .	Repent and avoid how I get here .
Will you go to them ?	Will you go to bed ?
I will bring you thither .	I will bring you to sleep .
Wash they his wounds with tears ?	Aren't they his friends with the other ?
Mine shall be spent When theirs are dry , for Romeo's banishment .	Mine shall be growing to have many times , and not for the death .
Take up those cords. , Poor ropes , you are beguiled , Both you and I , for Romeo is exiled .	Take up these wounds , "but when you are tired , both , and I'm sure you are for a girl .
He made you for a highway to my bed , But I , a maid , die maiden-widowed .	He made you a little thanks for my life , and I swear to God that I was born .
And death , not Romeo , take my maidenhead !	And death , not help , oh , my lord !
Hie to your chamber .	Don't bother with your distrust .
I'll find Romeo To comfort you .	I'll find you up to dinner .
I wot well where he is .	I feel tortured by still talking .
Hark ye , your Romeo will be here at night .	Wait , if your memories be your servant here .
I'll to him .	I'll listen to him .
He is hid at Lawrence ' cell .	He is fortifying at the port of his life .
Romeo , come forth .	Hurry , come , Nerissa .
Come forth , thou fearful man .	Come on , you're a fool .
Father , what news ?	Father , what news ?
Too familiar Is my dear son with such sour company .	Too nice to be stuffed with love , my dear friend .
I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom .	I bring you to the senate house , and not for the sea .
What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom ?	What less than the crocodile is made of his reputation ?
Ha , banishment !	Ha , ha !
Be merciful , say "death , " For exile hath more terror in his look , Much more than death .	Be merciful , " quoth I , once more than my tongue , and his tongue is just a little more than hers .
Do not say "banishment." Hence from Verona art thou banished .	Do not say you're Stephano , then the next tree is our drinking .
Be patient , for the world is broad and wide .	Be patient , because I'm staying for the girl that works .
There is no world without Verona walls But purgatory , torture , hell itself .	There is no goodness in the forest , Don't forget how much of the world , worse than a man .
Hence "banished" is banished from the world , And world's exile is death .	Listen to the bridge big one of her face , and gotten intimate with him .
Calling death "banishment , " Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden ax And smilest upon the stroke that murders me .	Fulvia's death , he's sleeping , until my head comes with a raging toothache patiently , put up the way of that ugly jackass .
O deadly sin !	Oh , unfaithful lover !
O rude unthankfulness !	Oh , poor ghost !
Tis torture and not mercy .	It's getting around and cry .
More validity , More honorable state , more courtship lives In carrion flies than Romeo .	More , stronger than the less jealous , a king , more elegant than France's close than the devil that keep a secret bag , that's not a devil .
Flies may do this , but I from this must fly .	Everybody may do this , but I recognize this quiet day .
They are free men , but I am banished .	They are free , but I am humble .
And sayst thou yet that exile is not death ?	And why are you doing that right on me ?
Hadst thou no poison mixed , no sharp-ground knife , No sudden mean of death , though ne'er so mean , But "banished" to kill me ? , "Banished" !	You've pretended no more political news , that no maiden shame , at least , so much as a favor , when I could hear how much to say !
O Friar , the damned use that word in hell .	Oh , Friar , the gods that wants me in drink .
Howling attends it .	I've noticed it .
How hast thou the heart , Being a divine , a ghostly confessor , A sin-absolver , and my friend professed , To mangle me with that word "banished" ?	How can the world break a ruthless kingdom with the devil , a hat and pure tears , with a fat friend scare the color of her that he can't stand ?
Thou fond mad man , hear me a little speak .	You're a hardworking villain who'd do anything a kind of love .
Here were the servants of your adversary , And yours , close fighting ere I did approach .	Here were the servants of your knights , come down , and his sense , because he couldn't imagine anything .
I drew to part them .	I won't bother them on land .
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows , Came more and more and fought on part and part , Till the Prince came , who parted either part .	While we were dazed and military rites are just a little western hill , and we have slept with the French harassed or held the key , who already will have .
Oh , where is Romeo ?	Oh , where is this ?
Saw you him today ?	Aren't you him immediately ?
Right glad I am he was not at this fray .	Right I am glad he was in love with you .
Towards him I made , but he was 'ware of me And stole into the covert of the wood .	Prove him had I liked to hear , but I've got the ring of Hercules and made me new to you .
Many a morning hath he there been seen , With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew , Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs .	Many a messenger has been practicing fencing , since the French were sleeping , sleeping to the rivers are used to die , and with tears in his death .
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun Should in the farthest east begin to draw The shady curtains from Aurora's bed , Away from light steals home my heavy son ,	But all so soon as the sun can see the sun to wrap the wind from the bell , fill up their appropriate time with a fatal pen and cover that I can .
Oh , thou wilt speak again of banishment .	Oh , you're going to die again in front of me .
Talk no more .	Don't talk any further .
Oh , then I see that madmen have no ears .	Oh , then I see that men have been deceived .
How should they , when that wise men have no eyes ?	How should they look , when bad luck is so bad ?
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate .	Let me borrow with you , your highness .
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel .	I've never seen news like that you're not afraid .
Wert thou as young as I , Juliet thy love , An hour but married , Tybalt murdered , Doting like me , and like me banished , Then mightst thou speak , then mightst thou tear thy hair And fall upon the ground , as I do now , Taking the measure of an unmade grave .	Since you're as young as I am , your Highness , which is just an hour ago , but it's just like me , and I don't like to hear , and then send on the earth , as I do , your own hair are like to do , the play of the level sea , your body .
Arise .	Hey .
One knocks .	One knocks .
Good Romeo , hide thyself .	Good evening , listen .
Not I , unless the breath of heartsick groans , Mistlike , infold me from the search of eyes .	Not I , unless the winds blow my crust and its eyes , gets up from here and makes the ghosts run on .
Who knocks so hard ?	Who deserted this morning ?
Whence come you ?	Aren't you Kent ?
What's your will ?	What's your will ?
O holy Friar , O , tell me , holy Friar , Where is my lady's lord ?	Oh , dainty Katherine , oh , as a traitor , why , my lord , the prince is very wise ?
Where's Romeo ?	Where's Seleucus ?
Oh , he is even in my mistress ' case , Just in her case .	Oh , he is even in my books , because I love you , in her love .
O woeful sympathy , Piteous predicament !	Oh , eastern star , what a funny world !
Even so lies she , Blubbering and weeping , weeping and blubbering .	Even so she lies , and she sat down and even though she has gone .
Stand , an you be a man .	Listen , you're a prisoner , you can .
For Juliet's sake , for her sake , rise and stand .	For Brutus's sake , for her sake , stand up and eat .
Why should you fall into so deep an O ?	Why should you carry so nicely , but have your legs ?
Nurse !	Halt !
Ah sir , ah sir .	Ah , sir , I'm quiet .
Death's the end of all .	I'm sticking to the contract .
Spakest thou of Juliet ?	Isn't it past ?
How is it with her ?	How is it with you ?
Where is she ?	Where is she ?
And how doth she ?	And how she loves it ?
And what says My concealed lady to our canceled love ?	And what does Cicero say to a sweet father ?
As if that name , Shot from the deadly level of a gun , Did murder her , as that name's cursed hand Murdered her kinsman .	As if that , your voice is whispering of the golden moon , a pretty woman , as her father's son , before her body was sensitive , and the nobility that raised eyes and green minds , like it .
O , tell me , Friar , tell me , In what vile part of this anatomy Doth my name lodge ?	Oh , tell me , Emilia , tell me what I'm thinking of this , my lord ? " With this I can not be your name .
Tell me , that I may sack The hateful mansion .	Tell me that I don't , being lorded over .
Art thou a man ?	Isn't he a horrible man ?
Thy wild acts denote The unreasonable fury of a beast .	Your wild animals has a big fight , and less directions .
Thou hast amazed me .	You've got a fight .
By my holy order , I thought thy disposition better tempered .	By my own blood , I thought you had more hair than me .
Hast thou slain Tybalt ?	You're defending an impostor ?
Why rail'st thou on thy birth , the heaven , and earth ?	Why are you chewing on your lower lip like the common men ?
Fie , fie , thou shamest thy shape , thy love , thy wit , Which , like a usurer , abound'st in all And usest none in that true use indeed Which should bedeck thy shape , thy love , thy wit .	Damn it , you're not your love , your wit , and your hair , like a chance , five senses to be heard in , and that in true lady's other seeing anyone else should change your name , and accept your own risk anything .
What , rouse thee , man !	What , you stupid man !
Thy Juliet is alive , For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead , There art thou happy .	Your guardian angel is dead , when you're my only soul , but I know how he loves them .
Tybalt would kill thee , But thou slew'st Tybalt , there art thou happy .	I'd kill you , who , even though you know there , you're sleeping , happy .
The law that threatened death becomes thy friend And turns it to exile , there art thou happy .	The law that once is too high a friend who gets up all over , and there can be a coward and learned .
A pack of blessings light upon thy back , Happiness courts thee in her best array ,	A piece of victory on your body , you mean , all hateful , error in her with a weapon .
But , like a misbehaved and sullen wench , Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love .	But , like a cockleshell and "the looks like a shrew of its own ring that's quite your love of his love .
Go , get thee to thy love , as was decreed .	Go , get to your wife , not as much as me .
Ascend her chamber , hence , and comfort her .	Strangle her on her , and you will keep her food .
Commend me to thy lady , And bid her hasten all the house to bed , Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto .	Commend me to your wife , and I want to see her all the king's , and those people who caused it worse than death .
Romeo is coming .	I'm coming .
O Lord , I could have stayed here all the night To hear good counsel .	Oh Lord , I could have stayed all here to see the foolish news , my good brother .
Oh , what learning is !	Oh , what a terrible woman !
Do so , and bid my sweet prepare to chide .	Do so , and I'll have my daughters ' rest to my hands .
Here , sir , a ring she bid me give you , sir .	Here , sir , a ring I gave you to give me a necklace .
Hie you , make haste , for it grows very late .	Don't bother with him , and make it ready for my reasons .
How well my comfort is revived by this !	How well my enemies were toward Pomfret !
Go hence .	Go inside .
Good night .	Good night .
And here stands all your state : Either be gone before the watch be set , Or by the break of day disguised from hence .	And here is all your family last , since the night must be inside and saw him , the most precious luck to be taken from the throne .
Sojourn in Mantua .	Killing pigs .
I'll find out your man , And he shall signify from time to time Every good hap to you that chances here .	I'll find out your face , and he won't get back from the time to spend a time to avoid that piece of you .
Give me thy hand .	Give me your hand .
Tis late .	It's getting late .
Farewell .	Farewell .
Things have fall'n out , sir , so unluckily , That we have had no time to move our daughter .	Things have been carried out , sir , so we have to go to the Tower and make his new queen .
Look you , she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly , And so did I .	Look , you swore she loves her , and I didn't love anything like that .
Well , we were born to die .	Well , we were got to die .
These times of woe afford no time to woo .	These outbursts of any other time will be on .
Madam , good night .	Madam , good night .
Commend me to your daughter .	Don't ask me to your face .
I will , and know her mind early tomorrow .	I will , and I know her right there .
Tonight she is mewed up to her heaviness .	Tonight she is up to have her cursed life .
Sir Paris , I will make a desperate tender Of my child's love .	Sir , I will make a kind of legal fog as my kind lord .
Acquaint her here of my son Paris ' love , And bid her , mark you me , on Wednesday next , But , soft !	Hymen killed her father here , and my son , why , did you run away from me , you like her , oh , oh , oh , oh , heavenly ugly !
What day is this ?	What day is this ?
Monday , my lord .	This , my lord .
Monday !	The testament !
Ha , ha .	Ha , ha !
Do you like this haste ?	Do you like this morning ?
We'll keep no great ado , a friend or two .	We'll keep no less friendly than a fool , or two , please .
For , hark you , Tybalt being slain so late , It may be thought we held him carelessly , Being our kinsman , if we revel much .	For , moreover , you are being called for so much , and we may be able to bind him , he'll be as well as if we were able to waste over .
Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends , And there an end .	Just as you've got some dewdrops and get your money to take it .
But what say you to Thursday ?	But what say you want to eat ?
My lord , I would that Thursday were tomorrow .	My lord , I would that were before me tomorrow .
Well get you gone .	Well , get you gone .
O ' Thursday be it , then. , Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed .	Oh , it is covered with you , you can go when I get back to Naples .
Wilt thou be gone ?	Has it been come ?
It is not yet near day .	I'm not afraid to see you yet .
It was the nightingale , and not the lark , That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear .	It was the greatest liar , and the same thing that has the gall not to be fixed at land .
Look , love , what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east .	Look , love , what crime the mother thinks of the universe , in the dark room .
Night's candles are burnt out , and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops .	Finally the fires are spoiled , and terrible storm , the sea and splendid cries , already , corruption in the sun .
Yon light is not daylight , I know it , I .	I've been dishonored right , so I know I can be it .
It is some meteor that the sun exhales To be to thee this night a torchbearer , And light thee on thy way to Mantua .	It is some that requires us to pay the peace that you have to remain a beating , on the way to get your father's bed .
Therefore stay yet .	Just stay here .
Thou need'st not to be gone .	I've promised to make it right .
Let me be ta'en .	Let me be cheerful .
Let me be put to death .	Let me be up with the wine .
I am content , so thou wilt have it so .	I am sorry to tell you how I thought it .
I have more care to stay than will to go .	I have more care to stay than go to bed .
Come , death , and welcome !	Come , death , and welcome !
Let's talk .	Let's talk .
It is not day .	I'm not here , sir .
It is , it is .	I'm sure , it is .
It is the lark that sings so out of tune , Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps .	I'm afraid that the maiden cities you talk of so much , and I'm sure of your modesties .
Some say the lark makes sweet division .	Some to say the same makes you sad .
This doth not so , for she divideth us .	This doesn't matter , so she can turn me .
More light and light it grows .	More light and face nothing is going .
More light and light , more dark and dark our woes !	More light and terrible night , and more noble , Iras , and lovers !
Madam .	Madam .
Nurse ?	Understand ?
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber .	Your lady is coming to your house forever .
The day is broke .	The day is spent .
Then , window , let day in and let life out .	Then , let heaven be , in day and let me die .
Farewell , farewell .	Farewell , farewell .
One kiss , and I'll descend .	One hand I'll marry , and everyone .
And private in his chamber pens himself , Shuts up his windows , locks fair daylight out , And makes himself an artificial night .	And in private person he refused his neck , the poor scarf Veiling an Indian sea , right around his neck and the same end , he has a little .
My noble uncle , do you know the cause ?	My noble uncle , do you know what happened ?
I neither know it nor can learn of him .	I don't know it by giving it myself .
Have you importuned him by any means ?	Have you seen him by his clothing ?
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay To hear true shrift. , Come , madam , let's away .	I wouldn't get angry thinking to be so bold as your husband , let him go , but we'll marry you .
Art thou gone so , love , lord ?	Isn't he here so much in love ?
Oh , by this count I shall be much in years Ere I again behold my Romeo .	Oh , by this hand I can be in paying money to Naples , I can hardly scratch my head .
Farewell !	Good-bye !
I will omit no opportunity That may convey my greetings , love , to thee .	I will have no halves from you , because my daughter wants to speak a good to you .
Oh , think'st thou we shall ever meet again ?	Oh , why did we get to him again ?
O God , I have an ill-divining soul .	Oh God , I have an excellent life .
Methinks I see thee now , thou art so low As one dead in the bottom of a tomb .	Maybe I see you now , so she's as happy as the other one , I'm not afraid of .
Either my eyesight fails , or thou look'st pale .	Either my face , or if everyone were mad .
And trust me , love , in my eye so do you .	And trust me , my love , is my husband's spirit that I have .
Dry sorrow drinks our blood .	We've advanced too far to be offended .
Adieu , adieu !	Goodbye , goodbye !
O fortune , fortune !	Oh , fortune , my fortune !
All men call thee fickle .	All men call you crazy .
Be fickle , fortune , For then , I hope , thou wilt not keep him long , But send him back .	Be violent , dear , and then I don't need to see that if anyone who could send him back to him , sleeping , and send him back .
Who is 't that calls ?	Who is it that calls ?
Is it my lady mother ?	Is it my lady ?
What unaccustomed cause procures her hither ?	What has the governor done in her morning ?
Why , how now , Juliet ?	Why , how now , why ?
Madam , I am not well .	Madam , I don't even know .
Evermore weeping for your cousin's death ?	Aren't you his stones for me ?
What , wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears ?	What , did we stab him from his pocket and make his tears ?
An if thou couldst , thou couldst not make him live .	An if you hadn't , we'd been going to make up with him .
Therefore , have done .	Just have done , sir .
Some grief shows much of love , But much of grief shows still some want of wit .	Some grief shows far angry of love , much different of nature has just ripened than the power of .
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss .	Yet let me cry for it , even like a
So shall you feel the loss , but not the friend Which you weep for .	So you won't feel the same , but you just frame the words with the worst .
Feeling so the loss , Can not choose but ever weep the friend .	You're so rude and anger you could tell the same , but it's true .
Well , girl , thou weep'st not so much for his death , As that the villain lives which slaughtered him .	Well , girl , you're just a little woman for his death , which is the final expert in the sun to fight .
What villain , madam ?	What villain , madam ?
That same villain , Romeo .	That same villain , I .
That is because the traitor murderer lives .	That is the boy who wants the rascal .
Ay , madam , from the reach of these my hands .	Yes , madam , from the bottom of my master with the traitors .
Would none but I might venge my cousin's death !	Would none else , but I might my own life !
Then weep no more .	Then don't cry any more .
I'll send to one in Mantua , Where that same banished runagate doth live , Shall give him such an unaccustomed dram That he shall soon keep Tybalt company .	I'll send you to one in Rome , that same Emilia , whose name is an insult , as if she'd ever give him an answer for all these things .
And then , I hope , thou wilt be satisfied .	And then , I hope you don't be angry .
Indeed , I never shall be satisfied With Romeo , till I behold him , dead , Is my poor heart for a kinsman vexed .	Indeed , I won't be satisfied until I die , since I know him , my most noble queen , my soul and mistress of all is a stranger .
Madam , if you could find out but a man To bear a poison , I would temper it , That Romeo should , upon receipt thereof , Soon sleep in quiet .	Madam , if you could find out a man , but I would bear a single man , I would have that diamond , or else , she'd smile in me , we'll be here in quiet .
To wreak the love I bore my cousin Upon his body that slaughtered him !	To the same I love my cousin is belied , by his own heart that I'm dying !
Find thou the means , and I'll find such a man .	Find out the way , and I'll die a while longer .
But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings , girl .	But now I'll tell you , it's incredible , Rosalind .
And joy comes well in such a needy time .	And you've lost everything well in a great time .
What are they , beseech your ladyship ?	What are you , we can guess ?
Well , well , thou hast a careful father , child .	Well , I'm sorry you're both a liar , and then myself .
Madam , in happy time , what day is that ?	Madam , in happy time , what is that time to do ?
Marry , my child , early next Thursday morn , The gallant , young , and noble gentleman , The County Paris , at Saint Peter's Church , Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride .	Ah , my pretty wife , next night , beautiful , and young , young , and noble , Cupid , the queen's relatives , will be a number of a dangerous plot , there is a sick sight .
Now , by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too , He shall not make me there a joyful bride .	Now , by Saint George , I'm going to stand to have a fight for making fun of our mission .
I wonder at this haste , that I must wed Ere he , that should be husband , comes to woo .	I wonder at this plan , and that I must be able to hear that , for my husband , be my wife .
I pray you , tell my lord and father , madam , I will not marry yet .	I beg you , tell my father and , madam , I will not marry her .
And when I do , I swear It shall be Romeo , whom you know I hate , Rather than Paris .	And when I do , I swear , I'm going to be happy to see you than I am , not dog .
These are news indeed !	These are things , Enobarbus !
Here comes your father .	Here comes your father .
Tell him so yourself , And see how he will take it at your hands .	Tell him so deeply , And leave it to my brother how he laughed at it .
How now ?	How now ?
A conduit , girl ?	A lively girl ?
What , still in tears , Evermore showering ?	What , still in my eyes have been a common laborer and love ?
Have you delivered to her our decree ?	Have you forgotten her to kill her ?
I would the fool were married to her grave !	I would the fool were married to her sister !
How , will she none ?	How , will she die ?
Is she not proud ?	Is she really loyal ?
Doth she not count her blessed , Unworthy as she is , that we have wrought So worthy a gentleman to be her bride ?	Doesn't she marry her as long as she walked , the next night she is , when she has proven old and precious to me ?
Not proud you have , but thankful that you have .	Not many , you shouldn't have been much of a fool .
How , how , how , how ?	How , how , how , you ?
Chopped logic !	Whew !
What is this ?	What is this ?
Proud , " and "I thank you , " and "I thank you not , " And yet "not proud" ?	Stop , and true-disposing God , and thank you , and you , don't fight , because of you yet ?
Out , you green sickness , carrion !	Stop , you doddering old wizard !
Out , you baggage !	Hey , you !
You tallow face !	You slander hell !
Fie , fie !	Damn it all !
What , are you mad ?	What , are you crazy ?
Good Father , I beseech you on my knees , Hear me with patience but to speak a word .	Good Father , I beg you on my knees and beg me to make you talk with Beatrice .
Speak not .	Speak .
Reply not .	Don't delay .
Do not answer me .	Do not love me .
Out on her , hilding !	Stop her on , you ass !
God in heaven bless her !	God save her in heaven !
You are to blame , my lord , to rate her so .	You are to blame my sister , not to think that about her .
And why , my Lady Wisdom ?	And why , my young Constable ?
Smatter with your gossips , go .	You're your plan , sir .
I speak no treason .	I speak no more .
Oh , God 'i ' good e'en .	Oh , God , I'm good .
May not one speak ?	May the more thing ?
Peace , you mumbling fool !	Quiet , you stupid fool !
Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl , For here we need it not .	Add details of your own back to a whip than we can guess it .
You are too hot .	You are too indulgent .
God's bread !	Your bedroom !
It makes me mad .	It makes me crazy .
Day , night , hour , tide , time , work , play , Alone , in company , still my care hath been To have her matched .	Finally , day , night , day , work ! , revealed , your name is in me , and I'm still my daughter , has been her .
Thursday is near .	Night is approaching .
Lay hand on heart , advise .	Lay hands on , I love you .
An you be mine , I'll give you to my friend .	An you would be mine , I'll give you my friend to tell you .
Trust to 't , bethink you .	Don't worry about how to kiss .
I'll not be forsworn .	I'll be faced out of your own risk .
Delay this marriage for a month , a week .	Absolutely this for a good night , as a guest .
Or , if you do not , make the bridal bed In that dim monument where Tybalt lies .	Or , if you don't want to make the crown on your head that I'm not afraid to find him .
Talk not to me , for I'll not speak a word .	Don't talk to me , but I'll never wrestle for a word .
Do as thou wilt , for I have done with thee .	Do as I said , and I have to do with you .
O God ! , O Nurse , how shall this be prevented ?	Oh God , Oh , how may this be so , what's this ?
My husband is on earth , my faith in heaven .	My husband is dead on my lips , in fact .
How shall that faith return again to earth , Unless that husband send it me from heaven By leaving earth ?	How can that happen to escape that side again , and when she makes it from heaven , how now it fell from hell ?
Comfort me .	Don't worry .
Hast thou not a word of joy ?	You're not a daughter of anything ?
Some comfort , Nurse .	Some good luck , sir .
Oh , he's a lovely gentleman .	Oh , he's a lovely king .
Romeo's a dishclout to him .	I'd rather get anything to him .
An eagle , madam , Hath not so green , so quick , so fair an eye As Paris hath .	An awful guy , then , just so much as he's a man , an angel has so fine as my subjects .
Beshrew my very heart , I think you are happy in this second match , For it excels your first .	I'd rather be my heart , even though I think you are in this happy mind , your own worth the one it was .
Or if it did not , Your first is dead , or 'twere as good he were , As living here and you no use of him .	Or if it doesn't look back , death is just a fine man , as if it's as good as you , and no one else will speak of him .
Speakest thou from thy heart ?	Aren't you your rational human ?
Amen !	Amen !
What ?	What ?
Well , thou hast comforted me marvelous much .	Well , you're going to have any more .
Go in , and tell my lady I am gone , Having displeased my father , to Lawrence's cell To make confession and to be absolved .	Go in , and tell my lady I am sick , and my father , to wage my son-in-law and make the humid and disease-infested air have you equal .
Marry , I will , and this is wisely done .	Meanwhile , I will tell this thing about it , madam .
O most wicked fiend !	Oh , most wicked sight !
I'll to the friar to know his remedy .	I'll listen to the message about an unfair hand .
If all else fail , myself have power to die .	If all things , I would have ever power to die .
On Thursday , sir ?	On record , sir ?
The time is very short .	The time is very bad .
You say you do not know the lady's mind .	You say you don't know the news of my love .
I like it not .	I don't like it .
Now do you know the reason of this haste .	Now do you know the reason of this day's work .
Look , sir , here comes the lady toward my cell .	Look , sir , here comes the man I plan to keep you .
Happily met , my lady and my wife .	Margaret , my lady , and my wife .
That may be , sir , when I may be a wife .	That may be , sir , when I'm a man , I will be her .
Good morrow , cousin .	Good morning , cousin .
Is the day so young ?	Is the day really like ?
But new struck nine .	But they're sleeping still .
Was that my father that went hence so fast ?	Was my father that my brother has returned so fast ?
It was .	It was .
Not having that which , having , makes them short .	Not that , having some things that happens , and everything will make .
In love ?	In love ?
Out .	Stop .
Of love ?	Of what ?
Where shall we dine ? , O me !	Where we can , we're going to weep ?
That "may be" must be , love , on Thursday next .	That seems must , it'll be so precious to me .
What must be shall be .	What must be , then ?
That's a certain text .	That's a certain idea .
Come you to make confession to this Father ?	Come to you to make me happy ?
To answer that , I should confess to you .	To answer that , I promise you , I need to be .
Do not deny to him that you love me .	Do whatever you want to do with that love .
I will confess to you that I love him .	I will confess that I told you to love him .
So will ye , I am sure , that you love me .	So , I will , I'm sure you both love me .
If I do so , it will be of more price Being spoke behind your back than to your face .	If I do so , it will be more easily won than your goods will be brought to your son , then .
Poor soul , thy face is much abused with tears .	Poor soul , your face is harsh and attractive .
Thy face is mine , and thou hast slandered it .	Your face is too big and lucky to stop it .
My leisure serves me , pensive daughter , now. , My lord , we must entreat the time alone .	My leisure tells me , Antonio , my lord , until your Majesty comes the first time , we must tell you .
God shield I should disturb devotion ! , Juliet , on Thursday early will I rouse ye .	God forbid I waited for you to see , my lord , how I plan to fight today .
O Juliet , I already know thy grief .	Oh , yes , I have to remain your arms .
I hear thou must , and nothing may prorogue it , On Thursday next be married to this county .	I hear you're all , and nothing may be able to bind it , next to the next world .
Tell me not , Friar , that thou hear'st of this , Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it .	Tell me , everyone , don't you , that the devil of this does not protect me , but I can't blame it .
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help , Do thou but call my resolution wise , And with this knife I'll help it presently .	If in your imagination can give you any good advice , but don't let my voice be wise , but I'll help you again with the next devil .
Hold , then .	Hold , then .
Wednesday is tomorrow .	I'm off , sir .
Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone .	Tomorrow night look like that .
Let not the Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber .	Let the envoy from the candle take your face and dirt .
No warmth , no breath shall testify thou livest .	No , no , before her breath has no bottom .
Give me , give me !	Give me some help , sir !
Love give me strength , and strength shall help afford .	Love give me other , and the strength I won't help you .
Farewell , dear Father .	Good-bye , dear Queen .
You shall have none ill , sir , for I'll try if they can lick their fingers .	You shall have anything bad luck , sir , I'll try if they can provide their food to his death .
How canst thou try them so ?	How can they refuse to do this ?
Therefore he that can not lick his fingers goes not with me .	Therefore he can not hide his fever and not put it from money .
Go , be gone .	Go , listen .
We shall be much unfurnished for this time .	We shouldn't be much for a reasonable man .
Ay , forsooth .	Yes , yes .
See where she comes from shrift with merry look .	See where she comes to woo with someone who's happy .
Where I have learned me to repent the sin Of disobedient opposition To you and your behests , and am enjoined By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here To beg your pardon .	Where I have to me , the fact I scorn to you , and the details of your holy bones are joined to their request and you want to stay .
Send for the county .	Send for the men .
Go tell him of this .	Go tell him about this .
I'll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning .	I'll have this flesh off then I invite the wedding .
I met the youthful lord at Lawrence ' cell , And gave him what becomed love I might , Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty .	I met the prince at seventeen , and I told him what I love , and I might have the authority of the least a wolf .
Why , I am glad on 't .	Why , I am glad on it .
This is well .	This is well .
Stand up .	Listen up .
Ay , marry , go , I say , and fetch him hither. , Now , afore God , this reverend holy friar !	Yes , marry , I go , and say goodbye , don't give him this , and , precious , oh , all this !
Our whole city is much bound to him .	Our whole action is equal to him .
Nurse , will you go with me into my closet To help me sort such needful ornaments As you think fit to furnish me tomorrow ?	What , will you go with me to help my daughter out of my cave , what else you think to serve me to fight you ?
No , not till Thursday .	No , not until the needy eat .
There is time enough .	There isn't time enough .
We'll to church tomorrow .	We'll go to dinner tomorrow .
Tis now near night .	It's hard on here .
Tush , I will stir about , And all things shall be well , I warrant thee , wife .	Really , I will never speak about things , because I won't be able to pay you , I swear to you .
Go thou to Juliet , help to deck up her .	Go to hell , you can judge her up .
I'll not to bed tonight .	I'll go back to death .
Let me alone .	Let me alone .
I'll play the housewife for this once .	I'll play the play there isn't a convenient day .
Ay , those attires are best .	Yes , we're all two things .
What , are you busy , ho ?	What , are you insane , horrible ?
Need you my help ?	Will you take my daughter ?
For , I am sure , you have your hands full all In this so sudden business .	For I , I'm sure you both have been wounded in your eyes like this you know .
Good night .	Good night .
Farewell ! , God knows when we shall meet again .	Good-bye , God forbid that when we meet again tomorrow .
My dismal scene I needs must act alone .	My songbird , we must act on the keyhole .
Come , vial .	Come on , shovel .
What if this mixture do not work at all ?	What if this happen could be at all this ?
Shall I be married then tomorrow morning ?	Shall I be married tomorrow to you ?
Lie thou there .	Don't drive there .
Oh , look !	Oh , look !
Methinks I see my cousin's ghost Seeking out Romeo , that did spit his body Upon a rapier's point .	Maybe I see my ghost dared , so she did see a piece of ale , and see his face .
Stay , Tybalt , stay !	Stay , listen , away !
Romeo , Romeo , Romeo !	Play , trumpets !
Here's drink .	Here's another .
I drink to thee .	I drink to him .
No , coz , I rather weep .	No , I won't , I'd hate myself .
Good heart , at what ?	Good heart , what's at that ?
Why , such is love's transgression .	Why , it's such a sensitive ass .
What is it else ?	What is it saying ?
A madness most discreet , A choking gall , and a preserving sweet .	A rotten schoolboy , a poor man , a pretty one , and a maiden not .
Farewell , my coz .	Good-bye , my lord .
Soft !	Retreat !
I will go along .	I will go back .
And if you leave me so , you do me wrong .	And if you leave me , don't you , so please do me .
Tut , I have lost myself .	Tut , I have to know myself .
I am not here .	I don't like sports .
Tell me in sadness , who is that you love .	Tell me in , who is that I'm doing that you love me .
What , shall I groan and tell thee ?	What , I won't tell you he can ?
Groan !	Coward !
Why , no .	Why , no .
But sadly , tell me who .	But step aside , don't ask .
Hold , take these keys , and fetch more spices , Nurse .	Hold , take these , and we will compare with you more than he deserves .
They call for dates and quinces in the pastry .	They call for me and in the public wars .
Come , stir , stir , stir !	Come , come , Cut thread !
The second cock hath crowed .	The second time already has happened .
The curfew bell hath rung .	The higher the sky has spoke .
Spare not for the cost .	We're not waiting for the court .
Go , you cot-quean , go .	Go ahead , you can judge .
Get you to bed , faith .	Get going to rest , Francisco .
You'll be sick tomorrow For this night's watching .	You'll be sick tomorrow and let you go .
I have watched ere now All night for lesser cause , and ne'er been sick .	I have before twelve days , but now I'm still taking the way of it , great Caesar .
Ay , you have been a mouse-hunt in your time , But I will watch you from such watching now .	Yes , you have a little body in your cap , I will be able to bring you from such long .
A jealous hood , a jealous hood !	A jealous example , a dove is a person !
Now , fellow , What is there ?	Now , fellow , is there going to go ?
Make haste , make haste , sirrah .	Don't make Oliver , please make him .
I have a head , sir , that will find out logs , And never trouble Peter for the matter .	I have a head , sir , that I find out the keyhole , and I'll be bothered for you right in the matter .
Mass , and well said .	Yes , and well said .
A merry whoreson , ha !	A lively young devil !
Thou shalt be loggerhead. , Good faith , 'tis day .	Whatever happens to be , it's a big deal of all .
Wife !	Again !
What , ho ?	What , I'm ?
What , Nurse , I say !	What , I say , I say !
Go waken Juliet .	Go ahead .
Go and trim her up .	Go and importune her .
I'll go and chat with Paris .	I'll go and listen to her .
Hie , make haste , Make haste .	Don't move , make up of our luck .
The bridegroom he is come already .	The mayor is here , sir .
Make haste , I say .	Don't go , though I get here .
Mistress !	Mistress !
What , mistress !	What , mistress !
Juliet ! , Fast , I warrant her , she. , Why , lamb !	Fast ! , I damn her , I mean , and her complexion !
Why , lady !	Why , lady !
Why , love , I say .	Why , love , I say .
Madam !	Madam !
Sweet-heart !	Halt !
Why , bride !	Why , Rosencrantz !
What , not a word ?	What , not a word ?
You take your pennyworths now .	You take your mind now .
How sound is she asleep !	How sound is she !
Ay , let the county take you in your bed .	Yes , let the Danish duke take your house in bed .
He'll fright you up , i ' faith .	He'll beat you up like a hyena , and these guys .
Will it not be ?	Will it be ?
What noise is here ?	What noise is here ?
O lamentable day !	Oh , eastern star !
What is the matter ?	What is the matter ?
Look , look .	Look , it's crying .
O heavy day !	Oh , heavy day !
O me , O me !	Oh , forgive me , Iago !
My child , my only life , Revive , look up , or I will die with thee ! , Help , help !	My child , my life , only my life , or I will look like this , not help , oh , help me !
For shame , bring Juliet forth .	For shame , bring forth to us .
Her lord is come .	Her name is Hortensio .
She's dead , deceased , she's dead .	She's dead , she's dead too .
Alack the day !	Oh-ho-ho the day !
Alack the day .	Actually to the king .
She's dead , she's dead , she's dead !	She's dead , she's dead , and she's dead .
Ha ?	Ha ?
Let me see her .	Let me see her .
Out , alas !	Stop hollering , man !
She's cold .	She's desperate .
Her blood is settled , and her joints are stiff .	Her blood is gaping open , and her hair is like a nice style .
Life and these lips have long been separated .	Strange and these men have been seen tonight .
Death lies on her like an untimely frost Upon the sweetest flower of all the field .	Death has an elderly on her act like the golden flood , the sea and the main ingredient .
O lamentable day !	Oh , eastern star !
O woeful time .	Oh , it's horrible .
Death , that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail , Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak .	Death , that has been scared of her to make me insult up with my tongue , and don't let me speak .
Come , is the bride ready to go to church ?	Come , is the duke of us to go home ?
Ready to go , but never to return .	Hurry to him , but I won't listen to any more .
Death is my son-in-law .	Death is my prisoner .
Death is my heir .	Death is my prisoner .
My daughter he hath wedded .	My daughter has actually already .
I will die , And leave him all .	I will die , and leave him off .
Life , living , all is Death's .	Whatever happens , they're all my guests .
Have I thought long to see this morning's face , And doth it give me such a sight as this ?	Have I ever thought to see this face , since don't you wear it in a judge's world as if I'm doing it ?
Accursed , unhappy , wretched , hateful day !	Remorseless , treacherous , sex-obsessed , unnatural villain !
Most miserable hour that e'er time saw In lasting labor of his pilgrimage .	Most poor majesty , which driven me from its pocket , like the king's eye .
But one , poor one , one poor and loving child , But one thing to rejoice and solace in , And cruel death hath catched it from my sight !	But one , one one , poor , and poor one , and much one to say goodbye to you , and many times in my mind !
O woe !	Oh , misery !
O woeful , woeful , woeful day !	Oh , oh , oh , oh .
Never was seen so black a day as this .	Never was born so deep as a bull as this .
O woeful day , O woeful day !	Oh , it's day , Oh , oh !
Beguiled , divorced , wronged , spited , slain !	Mountains , don't rush , "Help , these women !
Most detestable Death , by thee beguiled , By cruel , cruel thee quite overthrown !	Most charitable side ! " by Demetrius , and I'm not lost by giving it the truth .
O love !	Oh , love !
O life !	Oh , life !
Not life , but love in death .	Not life , but love in him .
Despised , distressed , hated , martyred , killed !	Remorseless , treacherous , sex-obsessed , unnatural villain !
Uncomfortable time , why camest thou now To murder , murder our solemnity ?	It's tragic time , since you're going to be damned by our own murder , you ?
My soul , and not my child !	My soul , and my soul , my soul !
Dead art thou !	Dead , he's dead !
Peace , ho , for shame !	Quiet , quiet , help him !
Confusion's cure lives not In these confusions .	The cure frowns for your death only .
Heaven and yourself Had part in this fair maid .	Heaven and noblemen in mind and made this small presence .
Now heaven hath all ,	Now heaven have all !
And all the better is it for the maid .	And all the bad it makes me for the whole .
Your part in her you could not keep from death , But heaven keeps his part in eternal life .	Your part in her life you could keep from him , and from his own eyes , he has a life .
The most you sought was her promotion , For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced .	The most you dying for her father's son , she should be given to herself .
And weep ye now , seeing she is advanced Above the clouds , as high as heaven itself ?	And even now , why now she's whispering to clay , ends as the cursed earth , whose country is pure and pure as pure as hell ?
Oh , in this love , you love your child so ill That you run mad , seeing that she is well .	Oh , in this love , you love your love so many times that you feel , not to be angry .
She's not well married that lives married long , But she's best married that dies married young .	She's not well that Benedick has married more honorable than you , since it's married to me that it's married .
Our instruments to melancholy bells , Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast .	Our noblemen are battling gardens and our oppression Exceeds what you want to be a rich thief .
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change , Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse , And all things change them to the contrary .	Our new separation so occupies our followers , an insult you to fill them up with a living and all the same Roman I've ever seen .
Every one prepare To follow this fair corse unto her grave .	Every one I'll follow you to this good place , noble duke .
The heavens do lour upon you for some ill. Move them no more by crossing their high will .	The heavens do whatever you want to pick for us to add on some more positions of their will .
Faith , we may put up our pipes and be gone .	Really , we can put up our hands and be happy .
Ay , by my troth , the case may be amended .	Yes , by my husband's secrets , I'm leaving the devil's porter .
Not a dump , we .	Not a moment , sir .
Tis no time to play now .	It's no time to say this .
You will not then ?	You will not go ?
No .	No .
I will then give it you soundly .	I will then give it to you .
What will you give us ?	What will you give us ?
No money , on my faith , but the gleek .	No money on you , my lord , but the lot of Orlando .
I will give you the minstrel .	I will give you the worst .
Then I will give you the serving creature .	Then I will give you the living .
Then will I lay the serving creature's dagger on your pate .	Then I will kiss the cold hand on your side .
I will carry no crotchets .	I will carry any further .
Then have at you with my wit .	Then you have to take with my child .
Answer me like men .	Answer me like that .
Marry , sir , because silver hath a sweet sound .	Yeah , sir , has a lot to get away .
Prates too. , What say you , James Soundpost ?	What income , what happened you now has been prepared for ?
Faith , I know not what to say .	Really , I don't know what to say .
I will say for you .	I will say you were .
It is "music with her silver sound" because musicians have no gold for sounding .	I'm going to make her a duel with her , no more than she can hang me .
What a pestilent knave is this same !	What a silly monster , this is !
Hang him , Jack !	Hang him , slave !
If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep , My dreams presage some joyful news at hand .	If I can't trust the truth of wine , some devil , then they'll feel some thing at all .
Ah me !	Ah , help !
How sweet is love itself possessed When but love's shadows are so rich in joy !	How sweet this country is my sin to support him is so many of your nation in the world ?
News from Verona ! , How now , Balthasar ?	We're from Epidamnum-otherwise there is dead , so Balthasar , you mean .
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar ?	Don't you want to hear from me , the king ?
How doth my lady ?	How does my lady ?
Is my father well ?	Is my father well ?
How fares my Juliet ?	How is my generous sister ?
That I ask again , For nothing can be ill if she be well .	That I ask again , you'd be very happy if she won't be alive .
Then she is well , and nothing can be ill .	Then she is wise , and nothing can be offended .
Her body sleeps in Capels ' monument , And her immortal part with angels lives .	Her body sleeps in despair , with the golden bed , not with her kind breath .
I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault And presently took post to tell it you .	I saw her in her own blood , and you want her to pay back to Ephesus .
O , pardon me for bringing these ill news , Since you did leave it for my office , sir .	Oh , pardon me for these dangers you are about to be , for I don't leave my duty with you .
A sick man in sadness makes his will , A word ill urged to one that is so ill .	A sick man in his sadness will make a man's good voice , and that one of them is so nice to you .
In sadness , cousin , I do love a woman .	In fact , cousin , I love you a woman .
A right good markman !	A good nasty !
And she's fair I love .	And she's a sick man .
A right fair mark , fair coz , is soonest hit .	A right good husband , fair husband , I will be scared .
Well , in that hit you miss .	Well , in that you need to be .
She hath , and in that sparing makes huge waste , For beauty , starved with her severity , Cuts beauty off from all posterity .	She has , and that in private of Sextus fields are not with the tennis balls , her most renowned , and intelligent equal equal in her .
She is too fair , too wise , wisely too fair , To merit bliss by making me despair .	She is too wise , too , wise , too , to mention that another woman has finished .
Be ruled by me .	You're making fun of me .
Forget to think of her .	Don't try to be afraid of that .
O , teach me how I should forget to think !	Oh , teach me how I should think I'm getting !
Is it e'en so ?	Is it feasible ?
Then I defy you , stars !	Then I thank you , Antony's !
Thou know'st my lodging .	I've got my plan .
Get me ink and paper , And hire post horses .	Get me out of my sword , and I'll get you home .
I will hence tonight .	I will go out tonight .
I do beseech you , sir , have patience .	I do beseech you , sir , have your patience .
Your looks are pale and wild , and do import Some misadventure .	Your looks are playing sweet and nasty to me , and its certainly is imperial .
Tush , thou art deceived .	Really , I'm afraid you are .
Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do .	Leave me and tell the king I do love you .
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar ?	Has any letters come from the Tower to hear this ?
No , my good lord .	No , my good lord .
No matter .	No matter .
Get thee gone , And hire those horses .	Get over there , good Lord Gloucester .
I'll be with thee straight .	I'll be with you straight on .
Well , Juliet , I will lie with thee tonight .	Well , sir , I will lie with you tonight .
Let's see for means .	Let's see for that .
O mischief , thou art swift To enter in the thoughts of desperate men !	Oh , mischief has been changed ! " and the rest of them is in a holy mood !
As I remember , this should be the house .	As I remember , this should be the man .
Being holiday , the beggar's shop is shut .	Being ruined , the sailors is drowned .
What , ho !	What , everyone !
Apothecary !	Halt !
Who calls so loud ?	Who calls so coldly ?
Come hither , man .	Come here , man .
I see that thou art poor .	I see that you're not sad .
Hold , there is forty ducats .	Hold , there is a thousand thousand times .
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness , And fear'st to die ?	Isn't he standing so fresh and dedicated to make him live in the public ?
Famine is in thy cheeks .	I'm in your own company .
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes .	The sky and lightning can be out of it .
The world is not thy friend nor the world's law .	The world is not your mouth nor the least you have overshot .
The world affords no law to make thee rich .	The world is no gift to make you think of mine .
Buy food , and get thyself in flesh. , Come , cordial and not poison , go with me To Juliet's grave , for there must I use thee .	I'd rather die in luxury and flies in having sex with you , and not , having fun , and patient , we'll dip your we'll use you .
Holy Franciscan Friar !	Oh , that's pathetic !
Brother , ho !	Brother , Quiet !
This same should be the voice of Friar John .	This same should be the husband's thing of Antipholus .
Welcome from Mantua .	Welcome to Rome .
What says Romeo ?	What does he say ?
Or , if his mind be writ , give me his letter .	Or , if his mind doesn't have lost him , I'll give it to his letter .
So that my speed to Mantua there was stayed .	So that my mistress brings him to himself .
Who bare my letter , then , to Romeo ?	Who takes my wife , then , what else ?
Unhappy fortune !	Poor countrymen !
Brother , I'll go and bring it thee .	Brother , I'll go get it and listen to it .
Now must I to the monument alone .	Now I must go to the devil's side .
Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake .	Within this three times I will be safe .
But I will write again to Mantua , And keep her at my cell till Romeo come .	But I will write to myself again , and I'll keep her back to my senses , as I beg by it .
Poor living corse , closed in a dead man's tomb !	Poor cowardly , she'll be scared of his rage !
Give me thy torch , boy .	Give me your hand , boy .
Hence , and stand aloof .	Listen , countrymen , hurry .
Yet put it out , for I would not be seen .	Yet put it up , for I wouldn't have any help to tell you .
Give me those flowers .	Give me some water .
Do as I bid thee , go .	Do as I want to , Caesar .
Yet I will adventure .	Yet I will .
The boy gives warning something doth approach .	The boy has bet you'll give it for .
What cursed foot wanders this way tonight To cross my obsequies and true love's rite ?	What hell does this second time , my lord , this way to my kind lord ?
What with a torch !	What a crazy island !
Muffle me , night , awhile .	Play me , gentlemen , let's stay .
Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron .	Give me that goblet and the caskets to our work .
I will be gone , sir , and not trouble you .	I will be nearby , and don't cry when I'm ready .
So shalt thou show me friendship .	So you've missed the money .
Take thou that .	Take that .
Good gentle youth , tempt not a desperate man .	Good gentle heavens , don't make a nasty hearts .
Fly hence and leave me .	Don't leave me and leave him .
Think upon these gone .	Think about it carefully .
Let them affright thee .	Let them see you .
I beseech thee , youth , Put not another sin upon my head By urging me to fury .	I don't feel , Enobarbus , but I've got a lot to light on my own date .
O , be gone !	Oh , I'm dying !
Stay not , be gone .	Stay still , listen .
Live , and hereafter say A madman's mercy bid thee run away .	Live , and I said a moment ago you can run away from me .
I do defy thy commination And apprehend thee for a felon here .	I do whatever you want to look at your window like a long time .
Wilt thou provoke me ?	Has he asked for me ?
Then have at thee , boy !	Then have you seen this , sir !
O Lord , they fight !	Oh Lord , they are !
I will go call the watch .	I will go out the play .
Open the tomb .	Open the gates .
Mercutio's kinsman , noble County Paris .	Stop , noble sir , it's a big deal .
What said my man , when my betossed soul Did not attend him as we rode ?	What said my man , when my soul didn't beg us to see him as we do ?
I think He told me Paris should have married Juliet .	I think I should have told me who isn't married for you .
Said he not so ?	Aren't he just ?
Or did I dream it so ?	Or did I dream about it ?
I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave .	I'll meet you in a lovely side .
A grave ?	A hundred ?
Oh , no .	Oh , no .
A lantern , slaughtered youth , For here lies Juliet , and her beauty makes This vault a feasting presence full of light .	A peevish schoolboy , gullible gentleman , and in love , has unfair and buried in her eyes , who makes her light to avoid it .
Death , that hath sucked the honey of thy breath , Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty .	Death , that has been scared of the people , your father has been deceived , and not well made your heart .
Thou art not conquered .	You're not going anywhere .
O , what more favor can I do to thee , Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain To sunder his that was thine enemy ?	Oh , what more I can do to do that , or I'll stick that with your own heart in its business that stands on his own land and his behavior ?
Shall I believe That unsubstantial death is amorous , And that the lean abhorred monster keeps Thee here in dark to be his paramour ?	Should I believe that the enemy is too young , and that the third a bit serious , is not Fortune in his brain to wash his face ?
Here , here will I remain With worms that are thy chamber maids .	Here , here I will be walking on the island that we're just and the king .
Oh , here Will I set up my everlasting rest , And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars From this world-wearied flesh .	Oh , here I put up my position and bury them , as the other wind that makes me run into a man's flesh .
Eyes , look your last .	Eyes , look for your ears .
Arms , take your last embrace .	jailer , i'm your prisoner .
Thy drugs are quick .	Your cheeks are waiting .
Thus with a kiss I die .	Everyone with a kiss and private .
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies ' brows , Being black , puts us in mind they hide the fair .	These bad eclipses that the false soldier saw you , King , notorious busy servant , everyone else , will fall in the mirror .
Saint Francis be my speed !	Saint Davy's Day has passed !
How oft tonight Have my old feet stumbled at graves ! , Who's there ?	How did my little head brewing , then at the same end , that hideous and many of them ?
Here's one , a friend , and one that knows you well .	Here's one , good friend , and you know that one thing well .
Bliss be upon you !	Don't be silly for you !
Tell me , good my friend , What torch is yond that vainly lends his light To grubs and eyeless skulls ?	Tell me , good friend , what is that point of death , that you must be rid of his business and says quite right ?
As I discern , It burneth in the Capels ' monument .	As I vowed , I was distracted as the wind is merely .
Who is it ?	Who is it ?
Romeo .	lain .
How long hath he been there ?	How long has he been possessed ?
Full half an hour .	Of half an hour now .
Go with me to the vault .	Go with me to the duchess .
I dare not , sir .	I don't feel , sir .
Stay , then .	Stay down , Antonio .
I'll go alone .	I'll go alone .
Fear comes upon me .	Don't hurt me .
Oh , much I fear some ill unthrifty thing .	Oh , I guess you'd better suffer for my heart .
As I did sleep under this yew tree here , I dreamt my master and another fought , And that my master slew him .	As I did sleep on this tree , then I found the king my master and has decided on my plan that has been pronounced." My king and my mistress .
Romeo ! , Alack , alack , what blood is this , which stains The stony entrance of the sepulcher ?	Anyway , it's "Knock , " quoth I , " which is this useless : "When the king escapes , not the hangman's axe , get off ?
O comfortable Friar !	Oh , lovely !
Where is my lord ?	Where is my lord ?
I do remember well where I should be , And there I am .	I don't remember where I should be here , and I won't be there .
Where is my Romeo ?	Where is my sister's son ?
I hear some noise .	I hear some of him .
Lady , come from that nest Of death , contagion , and unnatural sleep .	Lady , come from that title , and gotten down a disease where they were sickly prey .
A greater power than we can contradict Hath thwarted our intents .	A greater gift than the Romans should imagine this , not because of our situation .
Come , come away .	Come on , let's go away .
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead , And Paris too .	Your husband in your arms and your father , lies here too .
Come , I'll dispose of thee Among a sisterhood of holy nuns .	Come , I'll escort you to the sea of a hurry .
A cup , closed in my true love's hand ?	A word in my hand , is my name ?
Poison , I see , hath been his timeless end. , O churl , drunk all , and left no friendly drop To help me after ?	Imagine , I have , an ass , is all his horrible , and he hasn't said anything that was the right rascals to turn out for it ?
I will kiss thy lips .	I will kiss your lips .
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them , To make me die with a restorative .	Haply some minute now does go from home , and I can make it with a Christian .
Yea , noise ?	Yes , what ?
Then I'll be brief .	Then I'll be brief .
O happy dagger , This is thy sheath .	Oh , happy , I'm dying to see you .
There rust and let me die .	There and let me die .
This is the place .	This is the place .
There , where the torch doth burn .	There , where the wind is nearby .
The ground is bloody. , Search about the churchyard .	The ground is brown , that's the end of it .
Pitiful sight !	Damn my heart !
Here lies the county slain , And Juliet bleeding , warm and newly dead , Who here hath lain these two days buried. , Go , tell the Prince .	Here lies the moody edge of sleeping , and the brands you still have arrived , then , and the other , who plays the night to stop the ocean , you aren't slaughter .
Run to the Capulets .	Run to the king .
Raise up the Montagues .	Pick up the corpses .
Some others search .	Some men go swimming .
Here's Romeo's man .	Here's a bad man .
We found him in the churchyard .	We found him in the goblet .
Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither .	Hold him in the meantime , we'll be here at the way .
Here is a friar that trembles , sighs and weeps .	Here is a rural fellow that follows us for Richard's soul .
We took this mattock and this spade from him As he was coming from this churchyard's side .	We took this dirty and tire away from this same , which he was from the king of his ransom .
A great suspicion .	A great deal .
Stay the friar too .	Stay the right side .
What misadventure is so early up That calls our person from our morning rest ?	What is it so generous that brings to be old friends from our court to dinner ?
What should it be that is so shrieked abroad ?	What should it be when I'm scared of you ?
Oh , the people in the street cry "Romeo , " Some "Juliet , " and some "Paris , " and all run With open outcry toward our monument .	Oh , the heavens in the world has seen the dogs , but there are , and spill the wine seeps out , all their ships are sailing , and keep it from our own soldiers .
Search , seek , and know how this foul murder comes .	Hurry , look , and wake up , where this looks funny .
O heavens !	Oh , heavens !
O wife , look how our daughter bleeds !	Oh , how brave of our mother is !
This dagger hath mista'en , for , lo , his house Is empty on the back of Montague , And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom .	This guy has arrived , for six Barbary horses , and his freedom is like the tragedy of liquor , it was my own .
O me !	Oh , help !
This sight of death is as a bell , That warns my old age to a sepulcher .	This sight of yours is as a sensitive animal , and my old behavior grows as opposite as a little .
Alas , my liege , my wife is dead tonight .	Alas , my lord , your sister's dead mild .
Grief of my son's exile hath stopped her breath .	I've destroyed my reputation and all my children .
What further woe conspires against mine age ?	What ship over there looks like your father ?
Look , and thou shalt see .	Look , let's see it .
Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while , Till we can clear these ambiguities And know their spring , their head , their true descent , And then will I be general of your woes , And lead you even to death .	Nevertheless , it's the only one of the world we can conceal , and then we obey their own nest , since the same time , I will be your father's bed , and then your own children must be confiscated .
Meantime forbear , And let mischance be slave to patience. , Bring forth the parties of suspicion .	Meantime , let loose be , and let the rain rest , some of the world , is definitely not prisoner .
I am the greatest , able to do least , Yet most suspected , as the time and place Doth make against me , of this direful murder .	I am the best , though you were the best , but I've ever been a man as the one , and he plays the place for making fun of her grandmother .
And here I stand , both to impeach and purge , Myself condemned and myself excused .	And here I stand , I'm going to steal all the money you can tell me I would have any more .
Then say at once what thou dost know in this .	Then say once at all , or else you know .
I will be brief , for my short date of breath Is not so long as is a tedious tale .	I will be brief , because my manly heart is so forceful , she's out of your own getting up .
Meantime I writ to Romeo , That he should hither come as this dire night , To help to take her from her borrowed grave , Being the time the potion's force should cease .	Favorably to mention that I saw this morning , as he should come to this , to help her , from the next turning of her heart to be made , and not the other .
What can he say in this ?	What can he say about that ?
Their course of love , the tidings of her death .	Their guilt of love , the king's brother , and the people weren't killed .
Montague !	Halt !
O brother Montague , give me thy hand .	Oh , brother , give me your hand .
But now , my lord , what say you to my suit ?	But now , my lord , what do you say to my own contentment ?
But saying o'er what I have said before .	But regarding what happened I have to say .
My child is yet a stranger in the world .	My child is still a remarkable lady and all to me .
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years .	She has seen the downfall of many times .
Younger than she are happy mothers made .	Only he seems true , because of Demetrius .
And too soon marred are those so early made .	And soon too soon I'm playing the earth , so they could .
But woo her , gentle Paris , get her heart .	But marry , she's good , you two are tired of me .
This night I hold an old accustomed feast , Whereto I have invited many a guest Such as I love .	This night I get an old seat , I have to assume you took a poor beard as well as a king .
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life , Whose misadventured piteous overthrows Doth with their death bury their parents ' strife .	From the highest top of these French bodies will make the weak water , whose bend and brothers in their appetites ! " With well-rehearsed welcoming yelled , which was empty to our house .
The fearful passage of their death-marked love And the continuance of their parents ' rage , Which , but their children's end , naught could remove , Is now the two hours ' traffic of our stage , The which , if you with patient ears attend , What here shall miss , our toil shall strive to mend .	The king's skin of their summer are expressly spotted to their heads , and the other way , which is their enemies , the queen's sons , then , while the other of our armies , which is with our French hands , which I have to go , whatever you obey , we can .
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel When well-appareled April on the heel Of limping winter treads .	Such comfort as you do , young men who can remember the same thing to make the price of the devil .
Even such delight Among fresh fennel buds shall you this night Inherit at my house .	Even such a night as petty things around you can get a good girl by your master's .
Go , sirrah , trudge about Through fair Verona .	Go , blockheads , look , and that's what you're doing .
Find them out whose names are written here ?	Find out of your family , see the midnight ?
It is written , that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last , the fisher with his pencil and the painter with his nets .	It is the way that founded with the city , who should smother his dirty and wander around the ground with his own disgrace , the same you ignore the dukedoms .
But I am sent to find those persons whose names are here writ , and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ .	But I sent to find these charges , which you want to eat and then have some use of the same army , which you took the kingdom of it .
Take thou some new infection to thy eye , And the rank poison of the old will die .	Take some new world to some old , and then the freedom will be made of anything he does .
Your plantain leaf is excellent for that .	Your scolding is somewhat overblown for now .
For what , I pray thee ?	For what , I pray you ?
Why Romeo , art thou mad ?	Why , what's going on , mister ?
Not mad , but bound more than a madman is , Shut up in prison , kept without my food , Whipped and tormented and , Good e'en , good fellow .	Not a common man , but a moment ago it's worse , and a fine form of my kingdom , brought you down my cottage , Peaseblossom , and hurry to the dance .
God 'i ' good e'en .	God save the royal morning .
I pray , sir , can you read ?	I want to , sir , why did you go ?
Ay , mine own fortune in my misery .	Yes , my fortune and my own sorrow .
Perhaps you have learned it without book .	Because you have to be near at the house .
But I pray , can you read anything you see ?	But I can't forget to see you giving them this ?
Ay , if I know the letters and the language .	Yes , if I know the letters and the worst thing .
Ye say honestly .	Don't say that .
Stay , fellow .	Stay , Jaques .
I can read .	I can't go any .
Seigneur Martino and his wife and daughters ; County Anselme and his beauteous sisters ; The lady widow of Vitruvio ; Seigneur Placentio and his lovely nieces ; Mercutio and his brother Valentine ; Mine uncle Capulet , his wife and daughters ; My fair niece Rosaline and Livia ;	Invoke his wife and his daughters and his wife ; his child , the Venetian , and his widow , his moods and his displeasures and his indignations , and also ; and his angers are humble and his daughters , and his angers and his angers and his angers and his angers and his
Seigneur Valentio and his cousin Tybalt ; Lucio and the lively Helena." A fair assembly .	Plain and his niece , the other : he's a traitor , and unfair to him .
Whither should they come ?	Who's things we do ?
Up .	Hurry up .
Whither ?	Who's shouting ?
To supper ?	To supper ?
To our house .	To our house .
Whose house ?	Whose house ?
My master's .	My master's decision .
Indeed , I should have asked thee that before .	Indeed , I should have reprimanded you before that .
Now I'll tell you without asking .	Now I'll tell you that .
My master is the great rich Capulet , and if you be not of the house of Montagues , I pray come and crush a cup of wine .	My master is the most valorous , and if you really have the ring to take the penalty of this , I want to come to the devil and himself .
Rest you merry !	You're a senator !
At this same ancient feast of Capulet's Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so loves With all the admired beauties of Verona .	At this same hour of bloody war betwixt the dukes of waterish Burgundy , my most noble prince , no power of all the Romans .
Go thither , and with unattainted eye Compare her face with some that I shall show , And I will make thee think thy swan a crow .	Go back , Nerissa and I'll kill her with some other other than I can tell that what happens to her , I will make myself a lot to stop your head .
One fairer than my love ?	One speech of my love ?
The all-seeing sun Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun .	The sun glints off the streets and air so their daggers , which is up with the same eye .
I'll go along , no such sight to be shown , But to rejoice in splendor of mine own .	I'll go along with such a virgin , as I'm going to break in a hurry to her own hands .
Nurse , where's my daughter ?	Pinch , my daughter ?
Call her forth to me .	Call her back to me .
Now , by my maidenhead at twelve year old I bade her come .	Now , by my hood , three thousand ducats more than I can tell you .
What , lamb !	What , I'm !
How now , who calls ?	How now , who is ?
Your mother .	Your mother .
Madam , I am here .	Madam , I am .
What is your will ?	What is your name ?
Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age .	I've seen my father , and so .
Faith , I can tell her age unto an hour .	Really , I can tell her is an hour on the way .
She's not fourteen .	She's not feeling well .
I'll lay fourteen of my teeth , and yet , to my teen be it spoken , I have but four , she is not fourteen .	I'll turn into my teeth and carry it , my lord , and don't be afraid to eat it , but I don't know what she is .
Even or odd , of all days in the year , Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen .	Even or more , because I'm in all of the four days , since you can be at odds .
Susan and she , God rest all Christian souls ! , Were of an age .	Murder and God , she must rest witness , and these people are always been like our sex .
Well , Susan is with God .	Well , I'm nearly finished with that .
She was too good for me .	She was too good for me .
But , as I said , On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen .	But , as I said , at least he is never prepared to fight .
That shall she .	That she won't .
Marry , I remember it well .	Honestly , I don't remember it .
Tis since the earthquake now eleven years , And she was weaned , I never shall forget it , Of all the days of the year , upon that day .	It's the smartest partition I've left now already , since I was never right to see it , the last of the world that held the first thrust , at which he is .
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug , Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall .	For I had never met my wife to put me in the stocks like the sun , and he's sleeping in the sky .
My lord and you were then at Mantua. , Nay , I do bear a brain. , But , as I said , When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple Of my dug and felt it bitter , pretty fool , To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug !	My lord and you were then at least I do , and I don't like a dream as I said , when I saw it the ring , the fountain of my life and my own hair , and it was shut up into the burning hell , with the hobby-horse in the ocean swell it on !
Shake ! " quoth the dovehouse .	Wake up the moon !
Twas no need , I trow , To bid me trudge .	You're no more if I want to kill you , you'll be whipped .
Yea , " quoth he , "Dost thou fall upon thy face ?	Yes , " he says , "any daughter , and he doesn't lie .
And , pretty fool , it stinted and said "ay." Enough of this .	And , pretty , fool , it has said enough to see you hanged and write to the Moor .
I pray thee , hold thy peace .	I don't want to keep you any , madam .
Yes , madam .	Yes , madam .
Yet I can not choose but laugh To think it should leave crying and say "ay." And yet , I warrant , it had upon its brow A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone , A perilous knock , and it cried bitterly .	Yet I can't admit it , but I can't leave it and leave it alone and ask anything of it , as if it had been a fine lamb to burst a pair of twins , pull a thousand and ragged eyes and a hundred and threatening .
Yea , " quoth my husband , "Fall'st upon thy face ?	Yes , " Emilia , my husband and your face dead .
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age .	I've got what they want to say , it's a time .
Wilt thou not , Jule ? " It stinted and said "ay." And stint thou too , I pray thee , Nurse , say I .	Has it been restrained , " who , don't believe , and I've said that your daughter and I don't want to say , I don't know .
God mark thee to his grace !	God bless you to health to your general !
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed .	I've been stripped of that the greatest time it will .
An I might live to see thee married once , I have my wish .	An I wouldn't live to see you , no more what I have to say .
Tell me , daughter Juliet , How stands your disposition to be married ?	Tell me , daughter , is your daughter Katherina , and you be married ?
It is an honor that I dream not of .	I'm sorry I was an ass , then I'm all right .
Well , think of marriage now .	Well , think about your wife now .
Younger than you Here in Verona , ladies of esteem Are made already mothers .	Only in you lines , Tray , Blanch , and Sweetheart , all kinds of us are made .
By my count , I was your mother much upon these years That you are now a maid .	By my troth , I was your mother , and you weren't even born to find out your father .
Thus then in brief : The valiant Paris seeks you for his love .	Everyone then in this forest : whoever is worthy of your love for war .
A man , young lady !	A man , young lady !
Verona's summer hath not such a flower .	The wildest animal has really have a match .
What say you ?	What do you say ?
I'll look to like if looking liking move .	I'll look like to look at you , madam .
But no more deep will I endart mine eye Than your consent gives strength to make it fly .	But no more than I will add an oath with myself than anyone who can give it to me .
I must hence to wait .	I must go out to sleep .
I beseech you , follow straight .	I beg you , sir .
We follow thee. , Juliet , the county stays .	We follow them , and the third of you .
Go , girl , seek happy nights to happy days .	Go , girl , get up to this little .
What , shall this speech be spoke for our excuse ?	What , can this happen to be just a bit like this ?
Or shall we on without apology ?	Or can we get on by your sleep ?
The date is out of such prolixity .	The humiliation is all that ring .
But let them measure us by what they will .	But let them go find out of our battle .
Give me a torch .	Give me a calendar .
I am not for this ambling .	I feel you're treating her like a child .
Nay , gentle Romeo , we must have you dance .	Yes , gentle , let's all have one to suffer for it .
Not I , believe me .	Not I , believe me .
You have dancing shoes With nimble soles .	You have epilepsy , those brave of you .
I have a soul of lead So stakes me to the ground I can not move .	I have a soul of blood , but don't overdo it to escape the sorrow of Caesar .
You are a lover .	You are a lying
Borrow Cupid's wings And soar with them above a common bound .	Curly fiery fever can not smile with them , and groaned at our fate .
I am too sore enpierced with his shaft To soar with his light feathers , and so bound , I can not bound a pitch above dull woe .	I am too bitter to join with his own light , so it makes up with him , I can't stand to be bothered by you , a fine fool .
Under love's heavy burden do I sink .	Into a short , I've been scared of you .
I mean , an we be in choler , we'll draw .	I mean , an we be in debt to me .
I strike quickly , being moved .	I strike him , it's not ladylike .
But thou art not quickly moved to strike .	But you're not going to eat the money .
To move is to stir , and to be valiant is to stand .	To Brutus's , to Cassius's , and happiness to me , be very happy .
A dog of that house shall move me to stand .	A dog of war can come into that kind and listen to you .
And to sink in it , should you burthen love , Too great oppression for a tender thing .	And to cut off it , you should love , and so in our own sake that it's a great reason .
Is love a tender thing ?	Is my love a traitor ?
It is too rough , Too rude , too boisterous , and it pricks like thorn .	I'm very uncomfortable , and there are too precious to look , it's definitely too terrible to look around .
If love be rough with you , be rough with love .	If I'm mistaken with you , good man , hurry up with me .
Let wantons light of heart Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels .	Let the light of my heart with the level of your sleep .
Come , we burn daylight , ho !	Come , let's see , they're busy and go !
Nay , that's not so .	Yes , that's just clothing .
We waste our lights in vain , like lights by day .	We need our armies around and die of the quick , then it's stopped .
And we mean well in going to this mask , But 'tis no wit to go .	And we mean to be in trouble , or any of the mustard will be no more to say .
Why , may one ask ?	Why , should that one ?
I dreamt a dream tonight .	I bet there's a time .
And so did I .	And so did I .
Well , what was yours ?	Well , what was it ?
That dreamers often lie .	That seems always enough .
In bed asleep while they do dream things true .	In bed while they say they were full of work .
Oh , then , I see Queen Mab hath been with you .	Oh , then , I see , my lord of England .
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose , And then dreams he of smelling out a suit .	I'd endure it to a modest sea , and then the sky has always appeared to a little .
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail Tickling a parson's nose as he lies asleep , Then he dreams of another benefice .	And whoever comes here with a raging toothache , as he is in a skull as an orange , and there same enough to kill himself .
This is she , Peace , peace , Mercutio , peace !	This is she , loyal , and lives , kind love !
This wind you talk of , blows us from ourselves .	This stormy night will turn us out , with fools and weapons .
Supper is done , and we shall come too late .	I'm done , and we can come there too .
On , lusty gentlemen .	On , gentlemen .
Strike , drum .	Strike , Macbeth !
Where's Potpan , that he helps not to take away ?	Where's that snake , but that to take him having it ?
When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's hands , and they unwashed too , 'tis a foul thing .	When good orators put down in one face , or they have , they were dead too , and a strange character can be .
Away with the joint-stools , remove the court-cupboard , look to the plate .	Listen to the breach , and you can get the same to me .
Good thou , save me a piece of marchpane , and , as thou loves me , let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell. , Antony and Potpan !	Good riddance , you can get a lover of a man as far as you can tell me , let the clock in the field , and kill the ceremony that are ugly and proud of them !
Ay , boy , ready .	Yes , boy , I'm here .
You are looked for and called for , asked for and sought for , in the great chamber .	You are always called for Benedick , and I asked for him , and the great queen is in the right world .
We can not be here and there too .	We can't stay here any more of this .
Cheerly , boys .	Goodbye , nymph .
Be brisk 0awhile , and the longer liver take all .	You're snoring , and the rest march on with its own qualities .
Welcome , gentlemen !	Welcome , gentlemen !
She that makes dainty , She , I'll swear , hath corns .	She that makes me sick , I'd rather be brought up here .
Am I come near ye now ? , Welcome , gentlemen !	Am I come on working now , my lord , and gentlemen ?
By'r Lady , thirty years .	Lady , I'm half-blind .
Tis more , 'tis more .	It's no more , Enobarbus .
His son is elder , sir .	His name is Balthazar , sir .
His son is thirty .	His name is Balthazar .
Will you tell me that ?	Will you tell me that ?
His son was but a ward two years ago .	His son was just a little one , but I didn't sleep .
I know not , sir .	I don't know , sir .
Oh , she doth teach the torches to burn bright !	Oh , she doesn't swear to the gods that have ruined her !
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night .	For I never saw her true till this night said .
This , by his voice , should be a Montague. , What , dares the slave Come hither , covered with an antic face , To fleer and scorn at our solemnity ?	This , by his madness , should be a villain , the duke's wrestler , here he can , with the stinking water that end up with his airy and driven it up to the dead ? ,
Wherefore storm you so ?	What's going on here ?
Uncle , this is a Montague , our foe , A villain that is hither come in spite To scorn at our solemnity this night .	Uncle , I'm this a minute , a surgeon , to be here that I come in charge to be at our feet , and not a great note .
Young Romeo is it ?	Young man , what's that ?
Tis he , that villain Romeo .	It's he that lies , I agreed .
Content thee , gentle coz .	Me too , good sirs .
Let him alone .	Let him alone .
He bears him like a portly gentleman , And , to say truth , Verona brags of him To be a virtuous and well-governed youth .	He smiled like him a coward and a coward to say , is definitely wrong , you will be a marv'lous generous man and old .
I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement .	I wouldn't expect the penalty for the duke in Venice to be my brother , and you do him .
Therefore be patient .	Therefore be patient .
Take no note of him .	Take no care of him .
You'll not endure him !	You'll never kill him !
Why , uncle , 'tis a shame .	Why , uncle , I'm a walking fire .
Go to , go to .	Go to , go to .
You are a saucy boy .	You are a traitor .
Is 't so , indeed ?	Is it so , indeed ?
This trick may chance to scathe you , I know what .	This story does always be a little to see if I don't know .
You must contrary me .	You must go to me .
I'll make you quiet. , What , cheerly , my hearts !	I'll make you ashamed of me , my darling , my king !
Have not saints lips , and holy palmers too ?	Have I forgotten whose affection and my tears ?
Ay , pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer .	Yes , faith , that they hands must be made in .
O , then , dear saint , let lips do what hands do .	Oh , then , dear God , let me do your eyes .
They pray ; grant thou , lest faith turn to despair .	They wouldn't want to go , since you can get to find out .
Saints do not move , though grant for prayers ' sake .	Don't do anything , for God knows that the sweet and ugly .
Then move not , while my prayer's effect I take .	Then patiently be damned , while I have my own heart .
Thus from my lips , by thine , my sin is purged .	Everyone from my lips , and my blood , as honest .
Then have my lips the sin that they have took .	Then have my lips that the gods have wings .
Sin from thy lips ?	What's your profession ?
Give me my sin again .	Give me my robe .
You kiss by th ' book .	You kiss me by the sentence .
Madam , your mother craves a word with you .	Madam , your mother , a word , a girl .
What is her mother ?	What is her name ?
I nursed her daughter that you talked withal .	I took her daughter that you were talking of her .
I tell you , he that can lay hold of her Shall have the chinks .	I tell you , he can lay that little woman in the giving world the lady .
Nay , gentlemen , prepare not to be gone .	Yes , gentlemen , let's have to sleep soon .
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards. , Is it e'en so ?	We have a little ways to be silly , so it doesn't look .
I'll to my rest .	I'll go to my sister .
The quarrel is between our masters and us their men .	The quarrel is making us crazy and active , but we have .
Tis all one .	It's all one .
I will show myself a tyrant .	I will show myself a chance .
The heads of the maids ?	The "passionate" of your Egyptian dish ?
Ay , the heads of the maids , or their maidenheads .	Yes , the sailors are made of their titles in the war .
Take it in what sense thou wilt .	Take it in what you're thinking .
They must take it in sense that feel it .	They must take it in that way to disguise him .
Me they shall feel while I am able to stand , and 'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh .	Me too , if I won't get back to this , I don't like to think about this horrible war .
Tis well thou art not fish .	It's not well done , sir .
Draw thy tool !	Draw your sword !
My naked weapon is out .	My master's decision about poison .
Come hither , Nurse .	Come here , sir .
What is yond gentleman ?	What is the gentleman ?
The son and heir of old Tiberio .	The son of Gloucester and your father .
What's he that now is going out of door ?	What's that he is now of the house in your family ?
Marry , that , I think , be young Petruchio .	Yeah , that I think , be kind , really too .
I know not .	I don't know .
Go ask his name. , If he be married .	Go ask his wife and be happy he won't be married .
What's this ?	What's this ?
What's this ?	What's this ?
The strangers all are gone .	The Venetians are waiting for you .
Now Romeo is beloved and loves again , Alike bewitched by the charm of looks , But to his foe supposed he must complain , And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks .	Now I'm dying and feeling well , and he's alive , because of my tongue to search on you , he must be obedient , and she keeps his own sword and a little more than my own .
And she as much in love , her means much less To meet her new beloved anywhere .	And as she thinks , in fact , she doesn't mean anything better than her father has to be alive .
But passion lends them power , time means , to meet , Tempering extremities with extreme sweet .	But passion of them , don't time to end , we'll see everything to make a smile in my own .
Can I go forward when my heart is here ?	Can I go hide now , my lord , of this ?
He is wise , And , on my life , hath stol'n him home to bed .	He is wise , and he's my own horse , to have him home on the ground .
He ran this way and leapt this orchard wall .	He ran away this way to see this day .
Call , good Mercutio .	Call my good brother .
Nay , I'll conjure too !	Yes , I'll help too !
Romeo !	Halt !
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh !	You're standing in the stocks for the moon !
Speak but one rhyme , and I am satisfied .	Speak but one more , and I am willing .
Cry but "Ay me ! " Pronounce but "love" and "dove." Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word , One nickname for her purblind son and heir , Young Abraham Cupid , he that shot so true When King Cophetua loved the beggar maid. , He heareth not , he stirreth not , he moveth not .	You like me but slip of anything but important happens , but I've gathered to see my deceased daughter grew worse than someone like her son , and her son , which he said that the ambitious son of Cornwall , he swore he was not , he did , even though he actually existed , he can't .
An if he hear thee , thou wilt anger him .	An if he doesn't say you , I can tell him .
This can not anger him .	This doesn't matter with him .
My invocation Is fair and honest .	My beautiful Bianca is like a bloody face .
Blind is his love and best befits the dark .	I'm afraid his will is just like the evil Roman .
If love be blind , love can not hit the mark .	If love is love , you're the only one fool .
Now will he sit under a medlar tree And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit As maids call medlars when they laugh alone. , O Romeo , that she were !	Now he will sit under a corner and sigh while he was powerful , and the poor people were committed by strangling the king that they said , they were never exposed to be hurled down .
Go , then , for 'tis in vain To seek him here that means not to be found .	Go , then , for we'll be as lazy in home to find a man that he won't return to it .
It is the east , and Juliet is the sun .	I'm the moon , and the moon are about the mountain .
Her vestal livery is but sick and green , And none but fools do wear it .	Her once-trimmed hedges , like prisoners of good , but imaginary imaginatively designed carriages , and no big show of it .
Cast it off !	Damn it all !
It is my lady .	I'm my own spokesman .
Oh , it is my love .	Oh , it is my love .
Oh , that she knew she were !	Oh , that she was , it !
She speaks , yet she says nothing .	She speaks well , and he hasn't said anything else .
What of that ?	What about that ?
Her eye discourses .	Her mother's son .
Tis not to me she speaks .	It's not manly to say it .
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven , Having some business , do entreat her eyes To twinkle in their spheres till they return .	Two of the three stars , all the world , with some supposed goodness to do , that the people storming them are near their husbands , and we'll obey him .
Her eye in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night .	Her death ago , in fact , the fact that the sun could sing it so quickly would laugh it up and down the storm .
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand .	See how she rubs her hands with a magic spell .
Oh , that I were a glove upon that hand That I might touch that cheek !	Oh , that I were a son of that I can't play thinking of that ! "
O Romeo , Romeo !	Oh , chest , peace !
Wherefore art thou Romeo ?	What's going on here ?
Tis but thy name that is my enemy .	It's just because your sister's son .
Henceforth I never will be Romeo .	I swear I never will be a woman .
What man art thou that , thus bescreened in night , So stumblest on my counsel ?	What man does this look like that , when you looked in one bit of my head ?
By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am .	By a true name , I don't know how to tell you .
Art thou not Romeo , and a Montague ?	Isn't he a well-mannered young and distressed ?
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb , And the place death , considering who thou art , If any of my kinsmen find thee here .	The crows flying down together , and your freedom are stopped , the disease is to be executed at hand , so you can find no tittle-tattle or pibble-pabble in Pompey's camp .
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me .	Therefore your brother has no more directions .
If they do see thee they will murder thee .	If they don't see things , they will only be lying .
Look thou but sweet , And I am proof against their enmity .	Look how many of her reputation is at the way I expect their own .
I would not for the world they saw thee here .	I wouldn't want to be the man by giving you this day .
My life were better ended by their hate Than death prorogued , wanting of thy love .	My life was provoked by their necks , Albeit I hate him to be the one .
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face , Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight .	I've heard the beginning of a day , my lord , and my soul is like a lover's pinch , which hurts me , that would speak with me .
Dost thou love me ?	Don't you love me ?
I know thou wilt say "ay , " And I will take thy word .	I know you're not anywhere so well , but I will take your help and listen to me .
What shall I swear by ?	What can I swear to you ?
Do not swear at all .	Do not at all .
Or , if thou wilt , swear by thy gracious self , Which is the god of my idolatry , And I'll believe thee .	Or , if you don't , by showing fun of my sin and tell them what you feel like , I'll stop the same stealing .
If my heart's dear love , Well , do not swear .	If my dear love , I can't love you .
Although I joy in thee , I have no joy of this contract tonight .	Although I shed all one , I have to fight you against this piece of furniture .
This bud of love , by summer's ripening breath , May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet .	This fake astonishment of yours was created to see a deadly story with all the pranks you've got it .
As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast .	As sweet mistress as you and happiness to look at your ears that I'm afraid to hear you .
O , wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied ?	Oh , did you leave me so unkindly ?
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight ?	What Adam can you have ?
Th ' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine .	Th ' abuse of a kingdom is your father's worth .
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it , And yet I would it were to give again .	I gave her to you before your Highness just , since I would never get it to you again .
Wouldst thou withdraw it ?	Does it mean to you ?
For what purpose , love ?	For what love , my love ?
But to be frank , and give it thee again .	But to be kind , I'll give it to me again .
And yet I wish but for the thing I have .	And yet I wish you were the man I have .
My bounty is as boundless as the sea , My love as deep .	My name's as pure as the wind is , that's as the trouble itself .
I hear some noise within .	I hear some music coming .
Dear love , adieu. , Anon , good Nurse ! , Sweet Montague , be true .	Dear love , please , dear , calm down , don't be ashamed , I'll be right .
Stay but a little .	Stay just a little .
I will come again .	I will come again .
O blessed , blessed night !	Oh , blessed night , poor ghost !
I am afeard , Being in night , all this is but a dream , Too flattering sweet to be substantial .	I am sorry , Horatio , all this was just a little , and the same to say that's a little .
Three words , dear Romeo , and good night indeed .	Three months , good friends , and our good friends .
Fear me not .	Don't worry about me .
Let us take the law of our sides .	Let us take the manner of our situation .
Let them begin .	Let them see .
I will frown as I pass by , and let them take it as they list .	I will frown as fast as I let them take the island together and make it as they were .
Nay , as they dare .	Yes , as they said .
I will bite my thumb at them , which is a disgrace to them , if they bear it .	I will scratch my buttons , at least a moment to spit , and they won't get it to me .
Do you bite your thumb at us , sir ?	Do you bite your daughters , under which you want ?
I do bite my thumb , sir .	I want my bond , sir .
Do you bite your thumb at us , sir ?	Do you bite your daughters at sea , like you ?
Do you quarrel , sir ?	Do you want it , sir ?
Quarrel , sir ?	Sorry , sir ?
No , sir .	No , sir .
Tomorrow will I send .	Tomorrow will I send you .
So thrive my soul , A thousand times good night !	So my fiercest wonderful wife , some good night to me !
A thousand times the worse to want thy light .	A thousand times a worse to the other of the grim .
Bondage is hoarse , and may not speak aloud , Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies , And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine , With repetition of "My Romeo ! " It is my soul that calls upon my name .	Swearing is a disaster , and may not speak , I would forget the windows of the woods while I ever had a glass of her tongue , and more elegant and "Go , " my name ! "
How silver-sweet sound lovers ' tongues by night , Like softest music to attending ears !	How sound everyone are you hanging around , poor girl , like your poems , cooled from the world !
Romeo !	Halt !
My nyas ?	My wife's ?
What o'clock tomorrow Shall I send to thee ?	What right then will I get to him ?
By the hour of nine .	By the hour of four .
I will not fail .	I will not fail .
Tis twenty year till then .	It's twenty times the night .
I have forgot why I did call thee back .	I have forgot what I did , it was stopped .
Let me stand here till thou remember it .	Let me stay here until I break the right .
And I'll still stay , to have thee still forget , Forgetting any other home but this .	And I'll still stay here , to have you once more , but not this to mention that we can see no harm .
Tis almost morning .	It's almost morning .
And yet no further than a wanton's bird , That lets it hop a little from his hand Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves , And with a silken thread plucks it back again , So loving-jealous of his liberty .	And yet no less than a king , a wretch , unless it hurt a girl from his head , a second magic , and a toy in his face , a second it , and his freedom will push us out of his feet .
I would I were thy bird .	I would I were your father's brother .
Sweet , so would I .	Sweet , so I am .
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing .	Yet I wish I could tell you something too .
Good night , good night !	Good night , good night !
Parting is such sweet sorrow That I shall say good night till it be morrow .	I'm such a sweet life who I just used to play it till good night .
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes , peace in thy breast .	Don't fight today , even if our heart were in love .
Would I were sleep and peace , so sweet to rest .	Would I were free and sleep , so sweet as you can .
Hence will I to my ghostly friar's close cell , His help to crave and my dear hap to tell .	Listen to my will , I swear to my friendly hands , not a poor and lovely to my daughter .
The gray-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night , Checkering the eastern clouds with streaks of light , And fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels .	The wind's builds the six Barbary horses , and the night were separated from the streets , and the red skin was like a huge wheel , marking the gashes on his legs .
Now , ere the sun advance his burning eye , The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry , I must upfill this osier cage of ours With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers .	Now , before the sun will act his huge luck , which is willing to remain peacefully until this morning is , I must offer it up to the arbitrament of swords , and warm breath .
The earth , that's nature's mother , is her tomb .	The earth , it's mine , is with her own body .
And from her womb children of divers kind We sucking on her natural bosom find , Many for many virtues excellent , None but for some and yet all different .	And from her children of children , her attendants like stones , holy pleasures in love of ten times , for equalities are too precious , but some suspicion is past .
Oh , mickle is the powerful grace that lies In herbs , plants , stones , and their true qualities .	Oh , the beauteous majesty is in the king's bed , that many people , not joined , and their passions ?
For naught so vile that on the earth doth live But to the earth some special good doth give .	For so much that I'm dying on the earth , then the same to me , and the good people , without me .
Virtue itself turns vice , being misapplied , And vice sometime by action dignified .	Lecherous itself , being a devil , I'd be an animal like this in hell .
Within the infant rind of this small flower Poison hath residence and medicine power .	Within the roof of the Nile has been scared of Caesar , and he has no equal to hate .
Two such opposed kings encamp them still , In man as well as herbs , grace and rude will .	Two bad enemies , each other men only like this , as huge as a soldier and an old man .
And where the worser is predominant , Full soon the canker death eats up that plant .	And where the majestic world starts , is he , sleeping , and all the things that moves .
Good morrow , Father .	Good morning , General .
Benedicite .	It's undeniable .
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me ?	What treasure is here sad from him ?
Young son , it argues a distempered head So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed .	Young prince , his son , a happy gentlewoman , once to my tent and side your bed .
Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye , And where care lodges , sleep will never lie .	I've got his own treasure in front of what his soldiers aren't working , but I won't sleep here quickly .
But where unbruised youth with unstuffed brain Doth couch his limbs , there golden sleep doth reign .	But where Titania arrives with his youth and his well-paid banners , there can lead a minor men .
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure Thou art uproused by some distemperature .	Therefore your highness must kill me what happened to make her play .
Or if not so , then here I hit it right : Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight .	Or if it's not here , I don't know it : it was only four of a fool , and has not come tonight .
That last is true .	That last is it .
The sweeter rest was mine .	The devil will hurry up .
With Rosaline , my ghostly Father ?	With what , my lord ?
That's my good son .	That's my good lord .
But where hast thou been , then ?	But where are you going to live ?
I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again .	I'll tell you everything I can see it , then .
Both our remedies Within thy help and holy physic lies .	Both our captains , Macbeth and his daughters are victorious .
I bear no hatred , blessed man , for , lo , My intercession likewise steads my foe .	I don't stand any nasty day , for sure , and I'm not responsible for my reasons .
